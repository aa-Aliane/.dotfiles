It maintains context across different AI sessions, ensuring continuity, preserving architectural decisions, and tracking progress without needing to re-explain the project history every time.\n\n## File Structure & Usage\n\n*   **`context.md`**: The source of truth. Read this first. Contains the current state, active tasks, and architectural guidelines. Update this at the start and end of every session.\n*   **`todo.md`**: The backlog and task tracker. Organized by priority.\n*   **`decisions.md`**: An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) log. Records *why* technical choices were made.\n*   **`sessions/`**: Directory for archiving detailed logs of past sessions (optional/as needed).\n*   **`USAGE_GUIDE.md`**: Detailed instructions on how to use this system effectively with AI assistants.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Session Start\n*   **User/AI**: Read `.ai/context.md` to load the current state into the context window.\n*   **Action**: \"Please read `.ai/context.md` and `.ai/todo.md` to understand the current project status.\"\n*   **Update**: If `Current Focus` in `context.md` is outdated, update it before starting work.\n\n### 2. During Work\n*   **Consult**: Check `.ai/decisions.md` before making major architectural changes.\n*   **Update**: Tick off items in `.ai/todo.md` as they are completed.\n*   **Log**: If a significant decision is made (e.g., \"We will use Library X instead of Y\"), record it in `.ai/decisions.md`.\n\n### 3. Session End\n*   **Update Context**: Update `.ai/context.md` -> `Recent Changes` with a summary of what was achieved.\n*   **Update Focus**: Update `.ai/context.md` -> `Current Focus` for the *next* session.\n*   **Clean Up**: Ensure `.ai/todo.md` accurately reflects pending tasks.\n\n## Best Practices\n*   **Keep `context.md` lean**: It should fit easily into an AI's context window. Move old history to `sessions/`.\n*   **Be explicit**: When recording decisions, explain the *why*.\n*   **Atomic Updates**: Update the `.ai` files as part of your code commits so context travels with the code.\n\n## Quick Commands (Aliases)\n*   *Load Context*: `cat .ai/context.md .ai/todo.md`\n",

Use the `apps/<app_name>/models/` directory. Same for views and serializers.\n2.  **Imports**: Use absolute imports (e.g., `from apps.accounts.models import User`).\n3.  **Auth**: Respect JWT flow.\n\n### Frontend (Next.js) Rules\n1.  **Structure**: Pages in `src/app`. Components in `src/components`.\n2.  **Components**: Use `src/components/ui` for generic UI (shadcn). Use `src/components/<feature>` for domain components.\n3.  **State**: Prefer server components for data fetching. Use Zustand (`src/store`) for global client state.\n4.  **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes.\n"

            "content": "# AI Context Usage Guide\n\nThis guide explains how to effectively use the `.ai/` directory to get the best results from your AI assistant.\n\n## Quick Start (Copy-Paste Prompts)\n\n### 🚀 Starting a New Session\n**Prompt:**\n> \"I am starting a new work session. Please read `.ai/context.md` and `.ai/todo.md` to understand the current state of the project. Then, ask me what I want to work on today.\"\n\n### 📝 updating Context (End of Session)\n**Prompt:**\n> \"We are done for now. Please help me update `.ai/context.md`.\n> 1. Move the current 'Recent Changes' to the session log (or archive).\n> 2. Add today's changes to 'Recent Changes'.\n> 3. Update 'Current Focus' for the next session based on what we finished.\n> 4. Update `.ai/todo.md` marking completed tasks.\"\n\n### 🏗 Making Architectural Decisions\n**Prompt:**\n> \"I need to make a decision about [Topic]. Please review `.ai/decisions.md` to see our history, then propose options with pros/cons following the project's architectural guidelines.\"\n\n## Workflow Checklist\n\n1.  **Context Loading**: Always have the AI read `context.md` first.\n2.  **Task Selection**: Pick a task from `todo.md`.\n3.  **Implementation**: Work on the code, adhering to patterns in `context.md` (Notes for AI).\n4.  **Documentation**: If you change how something works, ask the AI to update the relevant `context.md` section.\n5.  **Logging**: Update `decisions.md` if a major choice is made.\n\n## Tips for Maintaining Context\n\n*   **Be Specific in `context.md`**: Don't just say \"Fix bugs\". Say \"Fix race condition in OrderController\".\n*   **Keep it Updated**: If the AI is confused, it's usually because `context.md` is outdated.\n*   **Use the `sessions/` folder**: If `context.md` gets too long (over 500 lines), move old \"Recent Changes\" to a file in `sessions/` to keep the main context lightweight.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n*   **\"The AI forgot we changed X\"**: You probably didn't update `context.md` at the end of the last session. Add it now.\n*   **\"The AI is writing code in the wrong style\"**: Point it to the \"Notes for AI\" section in `context.md`.\n"
