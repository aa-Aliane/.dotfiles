The primary goal is to extract architectural insights, particularly focusing on Docker configurations, environment variable management, and Django backend settings. Document this analysis and the decision to use this reference project for 'laicité-2.0's initialization in an Architectural Decision Record (ADR). The ADR should justify this decision based on establishing a \"solid basis\" for the 'laicité-2.0' project, avoiding \"AI slop,\" and aligning with the existing architecture document, Product Brief, and PRD. The ultimate goal is to enable the successful initialization of the 'laicité-2.0' project.\n</objective>"
