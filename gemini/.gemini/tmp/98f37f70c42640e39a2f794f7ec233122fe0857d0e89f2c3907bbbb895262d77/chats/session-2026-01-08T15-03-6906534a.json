Our session will be informed by key exploration areas such as User Problems and Pain Points, Feature Ideas, Technical Approaches, User Experience, Business Model, Market Differentiation, Technical Risks, and Success Metrics._\n\n### Session Setup\n\n_Content based on conversation about session parameters and facilitator approach_\n\n## Technique Selection\n\n**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques\n**Analysis Context:** Redesigning the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC website (v2.0) with focus on modernization, content hub, regional focus, engagement, and accessibility. Constraints include solo fullstack \"Docker maniac\" development, Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL stack with Shadcn UI (Vanilla CSS/BEM) and Framer Motion, and evolving client requirements (future authentication).\n\n**Recommended Techniques:**\n\n- **Six Thinking Hats:** For systematic analysis of current problems and new site potential, including architectural considerations for extensibility. (Expected: Multi-faceted understanding, risk identification, early architectural insights.)\n- **Five Whys:** To uncover root causes of existing site issues and ensure the redesign addresses fundamental problems, resilient to changing demands. (Expected: Core pain point identification, robust solutions.)\n- **SCAMPER Method:** For systematically generating innovative and stack-compatible feature ideas, and adapting project structure for future module integration (like authentication). (Expected: Rich list of actionable, stack-compatible features.)\n- **Analogical Thinking:** To draw inspiration for modern, visually appealing, and accessible UI/UX patterns, adaptable to your frontend stack. (Expected: New design patterns, content presentation, and interaction concepts.)\n- **Solution Matrix:** To systematically map features to technical components, explicitly planning for future authentication extensibility and a well-defined, Dockerized architecture. (Expected: Clear feature-to-component mapping, adaptable architecture blueprint.)\n\n**AI Rationale:** This sequence provides a comprehensive, structured approach for a solo fullstack developer tackling a complex website redesign with evolving client needs and specific tech stack requirements. It balances deep problem understanding, creative ideation, and architectural foresight to build a robust, modular, and future-proof solution.\n\n---\n## Six Thinking Hats - Session Summary (Continued)\n\nWe explored the redesign of the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC website (v2.0) through six distinct perspectives.\n\n### ⚪ White Hat (Facts & Information)\n\n*(Recap based on initial project context)*\nThe project aims to modernize the existing \"WordPress blog homemade\" website, which currently suffers from poor UX and a confusing menu. The core requirements include creating a content hub, focusing on regional content, enhancing engagement, and ensuring accessibility.\n\n### ❤️ Red Hat (Emotions & Feelings)\n\n*(Acknowledged previous discussion)*\nWhile not explicitly detailed with outputs in this session, we acknowledged the role of this hat in understanding subjective responses, which implicitly informed our exploration of negative user experiences and the desire for positive emotional engagement.\n\n### 💛 Yellow Hat (Benefits & Positives)\n\nWe identified significant benefits and opportunities including:\n*   Vastly improved usability and user satisfaction by addressing the current poor UX and confusing navigation.\n*   Enhanced professionalism and credibility through modern design, a clear brand personality, proper theme, and a standardized logo.\n*   Increased engagement and reach due to clearer menus, an appealing site, and optimized information architecture.\n*   Critical SEO advantages, leading to increased visibility, wider reach, and enhanced authority for the Observatoire.\n\n### ⚫ Black Hat (Risks & Challenges)\n\nWe uncovered crucial potential pitfalls:\n*   **Performance & Optimization Concerns:** Fears about page load times and search speed, and the challenge of ensuring optimal backend usage.\n*   **Search Engine Implementation Uncertainty:** Worries regarding the complexity of integration (Django backend, Next.js frontend), performance with growing data, effective indexing (articles now, events later), and the effort for a rich search UX.\n*   **Tech Stack Maintenance & Future-Proofing:** Concerns about managing the complexity of the chosen stack (Next.js, Django, numerous libraries) for long-term maintainability and adaptability.\n*   **User Acceptance:** Potential resistance to a new interface despite current UX issues.\n*   **Meta-Risk:** The fear of overlooking critical aspects or misprioritizing.\n\n### 🟢 Green Hat (Creativity & New Ideas)\n\nWe generated a wealth of potential solutions and innovative approaches:\n*   **For Performance:** Multi-layered caching, optimized media delivery, lazy loading, backend query optimization.\n*   **For Search:** Phased approach with PostgreSQL FTS, Django-Haystack integration, and frontend UX techniques.\n*   **For Maintenance:** Modular design, robust testing, CI/CD, documentation.\n*   **For User Acceptance:** Phased rollout, onboarding, feedback channels.\n*   **For Strategic:** Iterative development, regular stakeholder engagement, maintaining a 'parking lot' for ideas/risks.\n*   **Enhanced Features:** Interactive content, localized highlights, rich media integration, 'Laïcité in Action' showcases.\n--- End of content ---"

Work together as equals.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self contained instruction file that is a part of an overall workflow that must be followed exactly\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/create-product-brief/steps/step-01-init.md` to begin the workflow.\n"

Check for Existing Workflow State\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n**Workflow State Detection:**\n\n- Look for file `{outputFile}`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n**Continuation Protocol:**\n\n- **STOP immediately** and load `{workflow_path}/steps/step-01b-continue.md`\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle all continuation logic\n- This is an auto-proceed situation - no user choice needed\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nload context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Brainstorming Reports (`*brainstorming*.md`)\n- Research Documents (`*research*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Create Initial Document\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Copy the template from `{productBriefTemplate}` to `{outputFile}`, and update the frontmatter fields\n\n#### C. Present Initialization Results\n\n**Setup Report to User:**\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your product brief workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{outputFile}` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\n\n- Research: {number of research files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Brainstorming: {number of brainstorming files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project docs: {number of project files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project Context: {number of project context files loaded or \"None found\"}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nDo you have any other documents you'd like me to include, or shall we continue to the next step?\"\n\n### 4. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: \"**Proceeding to product vision discovery...**\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- After setup report is presented, immediately load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- This is an initialization step with auto-proceed after setup completion\n- Proceed directly to next step after document setup and reporting\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [setup completion is achieved and frontmatter properly updated], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin product vision discovery.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Existing workflow detected and properly handed off to step-01b\n- Fresh workflow initialized with template and proper frontmatter\n- Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n- All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n- Menu presented and user input handled correctly\n- Frontmatter updated with `stepsCompleted: [1]` before proceeding\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n- Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n- Creating document without proper template structure\n- Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n- Not reporting discovered documents to user clearly\n- Proceeding without user selecting 'C' (Continue)\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"

Our session will be informed by key exploration areas such as User Problems and Pain Points, Feature Ideas, Technical Approaches, User Experience, Business Model, Market Differentiation, Technical Risks, and Success Metrics._\n\n### Session Setup\n\n_Content based on conversation about session parameters and facilitator approach_\n\n## Technique Selection\n\n**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques\n**Analysis Context:** Redesigning the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC website (v2.0) with focus on modernization, content hub, regional focus, engagement, and accessibility. Constraints include solo fullstack \"Docker maniac\" development, Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL stack with Shadcn UI (Vanilla CSS/BEM) and Framer Motion, and evolving client requirements (future authentication).\n\n**Recommended Techniques:**\n\n- **Six Thinking Hats:** For systematic analysis of current problems and new site potential, including architectural considerations for extensibility. (Expected: Multi-faceted understanding, risk identification, early architectural insights.)\n- **Five Whys:** To uncover root causes of existing site issues and ensure the redesign addresses fundamental problems, resilient to changing demands. (Expected: Core pain point identification, robust solutions.)\n- **SCAMPER Method:** For systematically generating innovative and stack-compatible feature ideas, and adapting project structure for future module integration (like authentication). (Expected: Rich list of actionable, stack-compatible features.)\n- **Analogical Thinking:** To draw inspiration for modern, visually appealing, and accessible UI/UX patterns, adaptable to your frontend stack. (Expected: New design patterns, content presentation, and interaction concepts.)\n- **Solution Matrix:** To systematically map features to technical components, explicitly planning for future authentication extensibility and a well-defined, Dockerized architecture. (Expected: Clear feature-to-component mapping, adaptable architecture blueprint.)\n\n**AI Rationale:** This sequence provides a comprehensive, structured approach for a solo fullstack developer tackling a complex website redesign with evolving client needs and specific tech stack requirements. It balances deep problem understanding, creative ideation, and architectural foresight to build a robust, modular, and future-proof solution.\n\n---\n## Six Thinking Hats - Session Summary (Continued)\n\nWe explored the redesign of the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC website (v2.0) through six distinct perspectives.\n\n### ⚪ White Hat (Facts & Information)\n\n*(Recap based on initial project context)*\nThe project aims to modernize the existing \"WordPress blog homemade\" website, which currently suffers from poor UX and a confusing menu. The core requirements include creating a content hub, focusing on regional content, enhancing engagement, and ensuring accessibility.\n\n### ❤️ Red Hat (Emotions & Feelings)\n\n*(Acknowledged previous discussion)*\nWhile not explicitly detailed with outputs in this session, we acknowledged the role of this hat in understanding subjective responses, which implicitly informed our exploration of negative user experiences and the desire for positive emotional engagement.\n\n### 💛 Yellow Hat (Benefits & Positives)\n\nWe identified significant benefits and opportunities including:\n*   Vastly improved usability and user satisfaction by addressing the current poor UX and confusing navigation.\n*   Enhanced professionalism and credibility through modern design, a clear brand personality, proper theme, and a standardized logo.\n*   Increased engagement and reach due to clearer menus, an appealing site, and optimized information architecture.\n*   Critical SEO advantages, leading to increased visibility, wider reach, and enhanced authority for the Observatoire.\n\n### ⚫ Black Hat (Risks & Challenges)\n\nWe uncovered crucial potential pitfalls:\n*   **Performance & Optimization Concerns:** Fears about page load times and search speed, and the challenge of ensuring optimal backend usage.\n*   **Search Engine Implementation Uncertainty:** Worries regarding the complexity of integration (Django backend, Next.js frontend), performance with growing data, effective indexing (articles now, events later), and the effort for a rich search UX.\n*   **Tech Stack Maintenance & Future-Proofing:** Concerns about managing the complexity of the chosen stack (Next.js, Django, numerous libraries) for long-term maintainability and adaptability.\n*   **User Acceptance:** Potential resistance to a new interface despite current UX issues.\n*   **Meta-Risk:** The fear of overlooking critical aspects or misprioritizing.\n\n### 🟢 Green Hat (Creativity & New Ideas)\n\nWe generated a wealth of potential solutions and innovative approaches:\n*   **For Performance:** Multi-layered caching, optimized media delivery, lazy loading, backend query optimization.\n*   **For Search:** Phased approach with PostgreSQL FTS, Django-Haystack integration, and frontend UX techniques.\n*   **For Maintenance:** Modular design, robust testing, CI/CD, documentation.\n*   **For User Acceptance:** Phased rollout, onboarding, feedback channels.\n*   **For Strategic:** Iterative development, regular stakeholder engagement, maintaining a 'parking lot' for ideas/risks.\n*   **Enhanced Features:** Interactive content, localized highlights, rich media integration, 'Laïcité in Action' showcases."

This captures the essence of laicité-2.0 and what makes it special.\n\nHere's what I'll add to the document:\n\n```markdown\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC is redesigning its website (v2.0) to establish itself as the primary, authoritative, and user-friendly hub for laïcité information in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region. The current \"WordPress blog homemade\" site suffers from poor UX, confusing navigation, and ineffective content dissemination, leading to missed mission impact, credibility loss, low engagement, and poor visibility.\n\nThe vision for the new platform is to provide an ideal experience where users can effortlessly find relevant information—articles, events, official documents, and regional initiatives—within seconds, specifically organized by city. It will feature a modern, accessible, and visually appealing design that builds trust and enhances engagement across all devices. The initial focus will be on building a robust core content hub with intuitive navigation, regional organization, basic but effective search, and prominent visibility for key resources like \"Trophées de la laïcité\" and official charters.\n\nThis approach will differentiate the Observatoire by offering regional authority, city-level granularity, comprehensive content in one place, a modern user experience, and a modular architecture built for future growth. The goal is to transform the user experience from frustration to profound helpfulness, fostering a positive engagement cycle where users confidently declare, \"This is the place for laïcité in BFC.\"\n\n---\n\n## Core Vision\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nThe Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC currently faces significant challenges in effectively disseminating critical information—including articles, events, official documents, and regional initiatives—to the public. The existing \"WordPress blog homemade\" website is characterized by a confusing menu structure, poor user experience (UX), and limited functionality. Key content is often buried, navigation is unintuitive, and regional information is not well-organized by city, making it difficult for users to find locally relevant data. The site also lacks visual appeal, modern interaction patterns, and robust search capabilities, leading to low engagement and an undermining of the Observatoire's professional authority.\n\n### Problem Impact\n\nThe ineffective delivery mechanism of the current website has several critical negative impacts: vital information about laïcité principles and events fails to reach its intended audience, leading to reduced mission impact. The poor presentation erodes the Observatoire's credibility and professional legitimacy. Users quickly disengage due to frustration, causing lost opportunities for learning and participation. Poor SEO results in low visibility, making the Observatoire practically invisible to those searching for laïcité-related information in the BFC region. This ultimately leads to wasted effort for the association, as their carefully created content goes largely unseen due to technical and design limitations.\n\n### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short\n\nExisting solutions, such as national-level resources, scattered social media posts, direct outreach, general search engines, and word-of-mouth, all fall critically short in addressing the problem. National resources lack regional specificity; social media is ephemeral and unsearchable; direct outreach is inefficient and non-scalable; general search engines struggle with the Observatoire's poor SEO; and word-of-mouth has limited reach. The fundamental gap is the absence of a single, reliable, well-organized, accessible, and comprehensive source for BFC-specific laïcité information. This is due to fragmentation of information, technical debt from the \"homemade\" WordPress site, resource constraints for proper maintenance, and an initial underestimation of the intentional design required for effective information architecture and user experience.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution is the development of a modern, professional, and highly intuitive web platform for the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC. This platform will serve as the authoritative central hub for all laïcité-related information in the region, including articles, events, official documents, and press reviews. It will feature an ergonomic design that prioritizes user experience, offering clear navigation, powerful search functionality, and the ability to filter content by city. The site will be built with a Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL stack, utilizing Shadcn UI and Framer Motion for a visually appealing and responsive interface that works seamlessly across all devices. The initial implementation will focus on core content hub functionalities to address the most acute pain points, establishing a solid technical foundation for future growth and enhancements, such as authentication.\n\n### Key Differentiators\n\nThe new platform will stand out through several key differentiators:\n1.  **Regional Authority:** Positioning the site as the authoritative BFC voice with exclusive local content and official documentation.\n2.  **City-Level Granularity:** Unique organization of content by city, offering personally relevant information to users.\n3.  **Comprehensive Resource Hub:** Consolidating articles, events, documents, and press reviews into a single, unified, and searchable location, eliminating information fragmentation.\n4.  **Modern, Accessible Experience:** Delivering a professional design that matches the importance of the Observatoire's mission, moving beyond the \"homemade blog\" perception.\n5.  **Built for Growth:** Leveraging a modular Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL architecture to allow for future evolution and feature additions (e.g., authentication, interactive features).\n6.  **SEO-Optimized:** Implementing a proper technical foundation to ensure high discoverability through search engines.\nThese differentiators will collectively create a profoundly helpful user experience, leading to increased engagement, trust, and regular visitation, making the site the undisputed \"place for laïcité in BFC.\"\n```\n\n**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue",

The current \"WordPress blog homemade\" site suffers from poor UX, confusing navigation, and ineffective content dissemination, leading to missed mission impact, credibility loss, low engagement, and poor visibility.\n\nThe vision for the new platform is to provide an ideal experience where users can effortlessly find relevant information—articles, events, official documents, and regional initiatives—within seconds, specifically organized by city. It will feature a modern, accessible, and visually appealing design that builds trust and enhances engagement across all devices. The initial focus will be on building a robust core content hub with intuitive navigation, regional organization, basic but effective search, and prominent visibility for key resources like \"Trophées de la laïcité\" and official charters.\n\nThis approach will differentiate the Observatoire by offering regional authority, city-level granularity, comprehensive content in one place, a modern user experience, and a modular architecture built for future growth. The goal is to transform the user experience from frustration to profound helpfulness, fostering a positive engagement cycle where users confidently declare, \"This is the place for laïcité in BFC.\"\n\n---\n\n## Core Vision\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nThe Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC currently faces significant challenges in effectively disseminating critical information—including articles, events, official documents, and regional initiatives—to the public. The existing \"WordPress blog homemade\" website is characterized by a confusing menu structure, poor user experience (UX), and limited functionality. Key content is often buried, navigation is unintuitive, and regional information is not well-organized by city, making it difficult for users to find locally relevant data. The site also lacks visual appeal, modern interaction patterns, and robust search capabilities, leading to low engagement and an undermining of the Observatoire's professional authority.\n\n### Problem Impact\n\nThe ineffective delivery mechanism of the current website has several critical negative impacts: vital information about laïcité principles and events fails to reach its intended audience, leading to reduced mission impact. The poor presentation erodes the Observatoire's credibility and professional legitimacy. Users quickly disengage due to frustration, causing lost opportunities for learning and participation. Poor SEO results in low visibility, making the Observatoire practically invisible to those searching for laïcité-related information in the BFC region. This ultimately leads to wasted effort for the association, as their carefully created content goes largely unseen due to technical and design limitations.\n\n### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short\n\nExisting solutions, such as national-level resources, scattered social media posts, direct outreach, general search engines, and word-of-mouth, all fall critically short in addressing the problem. National resources lack regional specificity; social media is ephemeral and unsearchable; direct outreach is inefficient and non-scalable; general search engines struggle with the Observatoire's poor SEO; and word-of-mouth has limited reach. The fundamental gap is the absence of a single, reliable, well-organized, accessible, and comprehensive source for BFC-specific laïcité information. This is due to fragmentation of information, technical debt from the \"homemade\" WordPress site, resource constraints for proper maintenance, and an initial underestimation of the intentional design required for effective information architecture and user experience.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution is the development of a modern, professional, and highly intuitive web platform for the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC. This platform will serve as the authoritative central hub for all laïcité-related information in the region, including articles, events, official documents, and press reviews. It will feature an ergonomic design that prioritizes user experience, offering clear navigation, powerful search functionality, and the ability to filter content by city. The site will be built with a Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL stack, utilizing Shadcn UI and Framer Motion for a visually appealing and responsive interface that works seamlessly across all devices. The initial implementation will focus on core content hub functionalities to address the most acute pain points, establishing a solid technical foundation for future growth and enhancements, such as authentication.\n\n### Key Differentiators\n\nThe new platform will stand out through several key differentiators:\n1.  **Regional Authority:** Positioning the site as the authoritative BFC voice with exclusive local content and official documentation.\n2.  **City-Level Granularity:** Unique organization of content by city, offering personally relevant information to users.\n3.  **Comprehensive Resource Hub:** Consolidating articles, events, documents, and press reviews into a single, unified, and searchable location, eliminating information fragmentation.\n4.  **Modern, Accessible Experience:** Delivering a professional design that matches the importance of the Observatoire's mission, moving beyond the \"homemade blog\" perception.\n5.  **Built for Growth:** Leveraging a modular Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL architecture to allow for future evolution and feature additions (e.g., authentication, interactive features).\n6.  **SEO-Optimized:** Implementing a proper technical foundation to ensure high discoverability through search engines.\nThese differentiators will collectively create a profoundly helpful user experience, leading to increased engagement, trust, and regular visitation, making the site the undisputed \"place for laïcité in BFC.\"\n",

Begin User Discovery\n\n**Opening Exploration:**\n\"Now that we understand what {{project_name}} does, let's define who it's for.\n\n**User Discovery:**\n\n- Who experiences the problem we're solving?\n- Are there different types of users with different needs?\n- Who gets the most value from this solution?\n- Are there primary users and secondary users we should consider?\n\nLet's start by identifying the main user groups.\"\n\n### 2. Primary User Segment Development\n\n**Persona Development Process:**\nFor each primary user segment, create rich personas:\n\n**Name & Context:**\n\n- Give them a realistic name and brief backstory\n- Define their role, environment, and context\n- What motivates them? What are their goals?\n\n**Problem Experience:**\n\n- How do they currently experience the problem?\n- What workarounds are they using?\n- What are the emotional and practical impacts?\n\n**Success Vision:**\n\n- What would success look like for them?\n- What would make them say \"this is exactly what I needed\"?\n\n**Primary User Questions:**\n\n- \"Tell me about a typical person who would use {{project_name}}\"\n- \"What's their day like? Where does our product fit in?\"\n- \"What are they trying to accomplish that's hard right now?\"\n\n### 3. Secondary User Segment Exploration\n\n**Secondary User Considerations:**\n\n- \"Who else benefits from this solution, even if they're not the primary user?\"\n- \"Are there admin, support, or oversight roles we should consider?\"\n- \"Who influences the decision to adopt or purchase this product?\"\n- \"Are there partner or stakeholder users who matter?\"\n\n### 4. User Journey Mapping\n\n**Journey Elements:**\nMap key interactions for each user segment:\n\n- **Discovery:** How do they find out about the solution?\n- **Onboarding:** What's their first experience like?\n- **Core Usage:** How do they use the product day-to-day?\n- **Success Moment:** When do they realize the value?\n- **Long-term:** How does it become part of their routine?\n\n**Journey Questions:**\n\n- \"Walk me through how [Persona Name] would discover and start using {{project_name}}\"\n- \"What's their 'aha!' moment?\"\n- \"How does this product change how they work or live?\"\n\n### 5. Generate Target Users Content\n\n**Content to Append:**\nPrepare the following structure for document append:\n\n```markdown\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n\n[Primary user segment content based on conversation]\n\n### Secondary Users\n\n[Secondary user segment content based on conversation, or N/A if not discussed]\n\n### User Journey\n\n[User journey content based on conversation, or N/A if not discussed]\n```\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\n**Content Presentation:**\n\"I've mapped out who {{project_name}} serves and how they'll interact with it. This helps us ensure we're building something that real people will love to use.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 5]\n\n**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask} with current user content to dive deeper into personas and journeys\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow} to bring different perspectives to validate user understanding\n- IF C: Save content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter with stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3], then only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#6-present-menu-options)\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu with updated content\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu options\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [user personas finalized and saved to document with frontmatter updated], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin success metrics definition.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Rich, believable user personas with clear motivations\n- Clear distinction between primary and secondary users\n- User journeys that show key interaction points and value creation\n- User segments that align with product vision and problem statement\n- A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly with proper task execution\n- Content properly appended to document when C selected\n- Frontmatter updated with stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Creating generic user profiles without specific details\n- Missing key user segments that are important to success\n- User journeys that don't show how the product creates value\n- Not connecting user needs back to the problem statement\n- Not presenting standard A/P/C menu after content generation\n- Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n- Not updating frontmatter properly\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"
