                  "output": "The BMAD (Brian Madison) Method is a prompt engineering exercise that integrates the Software Development Lifecycle into a series of markdown documents, utilizing strongly opinionated system prompts with an LLM. It structures a project into \"Planning\" and \"Execution\" stages. The Planning stage involves creating documents like the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and architecture documents, often using lower-cost LLMs. The Execution stage focuses on code generation, typically with more advanced LLMs. The method uses personas (Analyst, Product Owner, Project Manager, Architect, Scrum Master, Developer, QA) embedded in system prompts.\n\nWhen interacting with the Gemini CLI, the BMAD method leverages a specific Gemini-related system prompt in a `.gemini/bmad-method/GEMINI.md` file. This allows the Gemini CLI to act as an \"Orchestrator\" that guides the user through the BMAD workflow. The process involves starting the Gemini CLI with a specified model (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash` for planning, `gemini-2.5-pro` for execution), providing an initial plan, and then interacting with different personas to generate project artifacts. The user is encouraged to frequently pause, review, and manually edit generated documents and code, committing changes to Git, to maintain control and ensure quality.[1]\n\nSources:\n[1] Dipping a toe cautiously in to vibe coding on the CLI with Gemini, Go ...

This command will set up the necessary BMAD markdown files, including the `GEMINI.md` system prompt, for Gemini to use.\n[1]\n3.  **Specific Commands or Phrases for Different Stages:**\n\n    *   **Starting Gemini CLI:**\n        *   For the **Planning stage**, use: `gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash`\n[1]        *   For the **Execution stage**, use: `gemini --model gemini-2.5-pro`\n[1]    *   **General Commands:**\n        *   To check if the BMAD Orchestrator is ready: `*help`\n[1]        *   To reset the current context: Press `Esc`\n[1]        *   To refer to a specific file (e.g., if the agent can't find it): Use the `@` symbol followed by the file path (e.g., `@docs/brief.md`)\n[1]    *   **Planning Stage (using `gemini-2.5-flash`):**\n        *   Initiate a plan with your project description: `*plan I want to develop a new project from scratch...`\n[1]        *   Choose a workflow (e.g., after the plan is entered): `*workflow greenfield-service`\n[1]        *   Interact with the Project Manager persona to create a Product Requirements Document (PRD): `*agent pm` followed by `*create-prd`\n[1]        *   Interact with the Architect persona to create an architecture document: `*agent architect`\n[1]    *   **Execution Stage (using `gemini-2.5-pro`):**\n        *   Engage the Scrum Master persona to break epics into stories: `*agent sm`\n[1]        *   Engage the Developer persona to iterate through stories, generate code, and unit tests: `*agent developer`\n[1]\n4.  **Mention of a GitHub Repository Containing the Prompts:**\n    *   The article states that BMAD's system prompts are located in `.gemini/bmad-method/GEMINI.md` and `.bmad-core` folders.\n[1]    *   These prompts are installed via the `npx bmad-method install` command, which places them in the correct location for Gemini to utilize.

The Workflow\nThe method is divided into two main stages: **Planning** (cheap/fast model) and **Execution** (reasoning model).\n\n#### Phase A: Planning\nStart Gemini with the \"Flash\" model:\n```bash\ngemini chat -m gemini-2.0-flash\n```\n*(Note: The article mentions `gemini-2.5-flash`, but use the latest available flash model if that one isn't released yet).*\n\n**Commands:**\n1.  **Start Orchestrator:** Verify it's working by typing `*help`.\n2.  **Define Goal:** Type `*plan I want to build [your project idea]...`.\n3.  **Select Workflow:** Type `*workflow greenfield-service` (or other workflows suggested by the help command).\n4.  **Create PRD:** Switch to the Product Manager persona:\n    *   `*agent pm`\n    *   `*create-prd`\n5.  **Create Architecture:** Switch to the Architect persona:\n    *   `*agent architect`\n    *   (Follow the agent's lead to generate architecture docs).\n\n#### Phase B: Execution\nRestart Gemini with the \"Pro\" model for better coding capabilities:\n```bash\ngemini chat -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05\n```\n\n**Commands:**\n1.  **Break down tasks:** Switch to Scrum Master:\n    *   `*agent sm`\n    *   Ask it to break the PRD/Architecture into user stories.\n2.  **Write Code:** Switch to Developer:\n    *   `*agent developer`\n    *   Implement stories one by one.\n\n### Summary of Key Commands\n| Command | Action |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `*help` | Show available agents and workflows. |\n| `*plan [text]` | Set the high-level goal for the session. |\n| `*workflow [name]` | Select a predefined process (e.g., greenfield). |\n| `*agent [name]` | Switch persona (e.g., `pm`, `architect`, `developer`, `sm`). |\n| `*create-prd` | specific trigger for the PM agent. |\n\n**Would you like me to run `npx bmad-method install` for you now?**",
