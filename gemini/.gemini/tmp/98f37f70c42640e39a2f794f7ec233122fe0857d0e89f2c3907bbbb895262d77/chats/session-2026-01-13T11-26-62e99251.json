          "description": "This tool can help you list out the current subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request. The list of subtasks helps you keep track of the current task, organize complex queries and help ensure that you don't miss any steps. With this list, the user can also see the current progress you are making in executing a given task.\n\nDepending on the task complexity, you should first divide a given task into subtasks and then use this tool to list out the subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request.\nEach of the subtasks should be clear and distinct. \n\nUse this tool for complex queries that require multiple steps. If you find that the request is actually complex after you have started executing the user task, create a todo list and use it. If execution of the user task requires multiple steps, planning and generally is higher complexity than a simple Q&A, use this tool.\n\nDO NOT use this tool for simple tasks that can be completed in less than 2 steps. If the user query is simple and straightforward, do not use the tool. If you can respond with an answer in a single turn then this tool is not required.\n\n## Task state definitions\n\n- pending: Work has not begun on a given subtask.\n- in_progress: Marked just prior to beginning work on a given subtask. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n- completed: Subtask was successfully completed with no errors or issues. If the subtask required more steps to complete, update the todo list with the subtasks. All steps should be identified as completed only when they are completed.\n- cancelled: As you update the todo list, some tasks are not required anymore due to the dynamic nature of the task. In this case, mark the subtasks as cancelled.\n\n\n## Methodology for using this tool\n1. Use this todo list as soon as you receive a user request based on the complexity of the task.\n2. Keep track of every subtask that you update the list with.\n3. Mark a subtask as in_progress before you begin working on it. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n4. Update the subtask list as you proceed in executing the task. The subtask list is not static and should reflect your progress and current plans, which may evolve as you acquire new information.\n5. Mark a subtask as completed when you have completed it.\n6. Mark a subtask as cancelled if the subtask is no longer needed.\n7. You must update the todo list as soon as you start, stop or cancel a subtask. Don't batch or wait to update the todo list.\n\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Create a website with a React for creating fancy logos using gemini-2.5-flash-image\n\nToDo list created by the agent:\n1. Initialize a new React project environment (e.g., using Vite).\n2. Design and build the core UI components: a text input (prompt field) for the logo description, selection controls for style parameters (if the API supports them), and an image preview area.\n3. Implement state management (e.g., React Context or Zustand) to manage the user's input prompt, the API loading status (pending, success, error), and the resulting image data.\n4. Create an API service module within the React app (using \"fetch\" or \"axios\") to securely format and send the prompt data via an HTTP POST request to the specified \"gemini-2.5-flash-image\" (Gemini model) endpoint.\n5. Implement asynchronous logic to handle the API call: show a loading indicator while the request is pending, retrieve the generated image (e.g., as a URL or base64 string) upon success, and display any errors.\n6. Display the returned \"fancy logo\" from the API response in the preview area component.\n7. Add functionality (e.g., a \"Download\" button) to allow the user to save the generated image file.\n8. Deploy the application to a web server or hosting platform.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent used the todo list to break the task into distinct, manageable steps:\n1. Building an entire interactive web application from scratch is a highly complex, multi-stage process involving setup, UI development, logic integration, and deployment.\n2. The agent inferred the core functionality required for a \"logo creator,\" such as UI controls for customization (Task 3) and an export feature (Task 7), which must be tracked as distinct goals.\n3. The agent rightly inferred the requirement of an API service model for interacting with the image model endpoint.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Ensure that the test <test file> passes.\n\nAgent:\n<Goes into a loop of running the test, identifying errors, and updating the code until the test passes.>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent did not use the todo list because this task could be completed by a tight loop of execute test->edit->execute test.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n",

To avoid starting from scratch and potentially introducing \"AI slop\" or less-than-optimal architectural patterns, a decision was made to leverage an existing, high-quality reference project as a blueprint for the initial project setup. This reference project utilizes a similar technology stack (Docker, Django, Next.js) to the planned `laicité-2.0` implementation.\n\n## Decision\n\nThe `laicité-2.0` project will adopt the architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure observed in the provided reference project. This includes its approach to containerization with Docker Compose, configuration management using environment variables and `django-environ`, the structure of its Django backend, and its modern Next.js/React frontend setup.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe reference project provides an exemplary architectural foundation for a modern web application, embodying experienced, human-led architectural decisions. Its key strengths, making it an ideal starting point for `laicité-2.0`, are:\n\n1.  **Containerization & Orchestration:** The use of `docker-compose` facilitates a portable, single-command development environment, cleanly separating `db`, `backend`, and `frontend` services. This promotes consistency across development environments and simplifies deployment.\n2.  **Configuration Management:** The project demonstrates a best-practice approach by using `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` to inject environment-specific variables from a well-organized `.envs` directory. The Django backend then safely consumes these variables via `django-environ`, ensuring a clean separation of code and configuration and enhancing security.\n3.  **Robust Backend:** The Django backend is modular and well-structured, built for scalability and features. It includes pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and provides stubs for advanced components like full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n4.  **Modern Frontend:** The frontend stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript) is state-of-the-art. It utilizes TanStack React Query for sophisticated server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a productive UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui` principles. This ensures a modern, performant, and maintainable user interface.\n\nThis combination of industry-standard tools and proven patterns ensures `laicité-2.0` begins with a professional, scalable, and well-documented structure, significantly reducing initial setup time and architectural risks.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive\n\n*   **Accelerated Development:** A solid architectural foundation allows the team to focus on feature implementation rather than foundational setup.\n*   **Best Practices Adherence:** The project benefits from battle-tested patterns for containerization, configuration, and technology choices.\n*   **Improved Maintainability:** A well-defined and structured project is easier to understand, debug, and extend.\n*   **Scalability Potential:** The chosen technologies and patterns support future scaling of the application.\n*   **Reduced Risk:** Minimized architectural \"unknowns\" and common pitfalls.\n\n### Negative\n\n*   **Learning Curve:** Team members unfamiliar with specific tools or patterns used in the reference project (e.g., `django-environ`, TanStack React Query, `shadcn-ui`) may require an initial learning period.\n*   **Minor Adjustments:** While largely adopted, some specific configurations or features from the reference project may need minor adjustments to perfectly align with `laicité-2.0`'s unique requirements.\n*   **Hardcoded Password:** A minor flaw (hardcoded password in `settings.py` in the reference) must be addressed immediately during initialization to maintain security best practices.\n"

The list of subtasks helps you keep track of the current task, organize complex queries and help ensure that you don't miss any steps. With this list, the user can also see the current progress you are making in executing a given task.\n\nDepending on the task complexity, you should first divide a given task into subtasks and then use this tool to list out the subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request.\nEach of the subtasks should be clear and distinct. \n\nUse this tool for complex queries that require multiple steps. If you find that the request is actually complex after you have started executing the user task, create a todo list and use it. If execution of the user task requires multiple steps, planning and generally is higher complexity than a simple Q&A, use this tool.\n\nDO NOT use this tool for simple tasks that can be completed in less than 2 steps. If the user query is simple and straightforward, do not use the tool. If you can respond with an answer in a single turn then this tool is not required.\n\n## Task state definitions\n\n- pending: Work has not begun on a given subtask.\n- in_progress: Marked just prior to beginning work on a given subtask. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n- completed: Subtask was successfully completed with no errors or issues.

In this case, mark the subtasks as cancelled.\n\n\n## Methodology for using this tool\n1. Use this todo list as soon as you receive a user request based on the complexity of the task.\n2. Keep track of every subtask that you update the list with.\n3. Mark a subtask as in_progress before you begin working on it. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.\n4.

Initialize a new React project environment (e.g., using Vite).\n2. Design and build the core UI components: a text input (prompt field) for the logo description, selection controls for style parameters (if the API supports them), and an image preview area.\n3. Implement state management (e.g., React Context or Zustand) to manage the user's input prompt, the API loading status (pending, success, error), and the resulting image data.\n4. Create an API service module within the React app (using \"fetch\" or \"axios\") to securely format and send the prompt data via an HTTP POST request to the specified \"gemini-2.5-flash-image\" (Gemini model) endpoint.\n5. Implement asynchronous logic to handle the API call: show a loading indicator while the request is pending, retrieve the generated image (e.g., as a URL or base64 string) upon success, and display any errors.\n6. Display the returned \"fancy logo\" from the API response in the preview area component.\n7. Add functionality (e.g., a \"Download\" button) to allow the user to save the generated image file.\n8. Deploy the application to a web server or hosting platform.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent used the todo list to break the task into distinct, manageable steps:\n1. Building an entire interactive web application from scratch is a highly complex, multi-stage process involving setup, UI development, logic integration, and deployment.\n2. The agent inferred the core functionality required for a \"logo creator,\" such as UI controls for customization (Task 3) and an export feature (Task 7), which must be tracked as distinct goals.\n3. The agent rightly inferred the requirement of an API service model for interacting with the image model endpoint.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser request: Ensure that the test <test file> passes.\n\nAgent:\n<Goes into a loop of running the test, identifying errors, and updating the code until the test passes.>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe agent did not use the todo list because this task could be completed by a tight loop of execute test->edit->execute test.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n",

It maintains context across different AI sessions, ensuring continuity, preserving architectural decisions, and tracking progress without needing to re-explain the project history every time.\n\n## File Structure & Usage\n\n*   **`context.md`**: The source of truth. Read this first. Contains the current state, active tasks, and architectural guidelines. Update this at the start and end of every session.\n*   **`todo.md`**: The backlog and task tracker. Organized by priority.\n*   **`decisions.md`**: An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) log. Records *why* technical choices were made.\n*   **`sessions/`**: Directory for archiving detailed logs of past sessions (optional/as needed).\n*   **`USAGE_GUIDE.md`**: Detailed instructions on how to use this system effectively with AI assistants.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Session Start\n*   **User/AI**: Read `.ai/context.md` to load the current state into the context window.\n*   **Action**: \"Please read `.ai/context.md` and `.ai/todo.md` to understand the current project status.\"\n*   **Update**: If `Current Focus` in `context.md` is outdated, update it before starting work.\n\n### 2. During Work\n*   **Consult**: Check `.ai/decisions.md` before making major architectural changes.\n*   **Update**: Tick off items in `.ai/todo.md` as they are completed.\n*   **Log**: If a significant decision is made (e.g., \"We will use Library X instead of Y\"), record it in `.ai/decisions.md`.\n\n### 3. Session End\n*   **Update Context**: Update `.ai/context.md` -> `Recent Changes` with a summary of what was achieved.\n*   **Update Focus**: Update `.ai/context.md` -> `Current Focus` for the *next* session.\n*   **Clean Up**: Ensure `.ai/todo.md` accurately reflects pending tasks.\n\n## Best Practices\n*   **Keep `context.md` lean**: It should fit easily into an AI's context window. Move old history to `sessions/`.\n*   **Be explicit**: When recording decisions, explain the *why*.\n*   **Atomic Updates**: Update the `.ai` files as part of your code commits so context travels with the code.\n\n## Quick Commands (Aliases)\n*   *Load Context*: `cat .ai/context.md .ai/todo.md`\nContent from @reference/.ai/USAGE_GUIDE.md:\n# AI Context Usage Guide\n\nThis guide explains how to effectively use the `.ai/` directory to get the best results from your AI assistant.\n\n## Quick Start (Copy-Paste Prompts)\n\n### 🚀 Starting a New Session\n**Prompt:**\n> \"I am starting a new work session. Please read `.ai/context.md` and `.ai/todo.md` to understand the current state of the project. Then, ask me what I want to work on today.\"\n\n### 📝 updating Context (End of Session)\n**Prompt:**\n> \"We are done for now. Please help me update `.ai/context.md`.\n> 1. Move the current 'Recent Changes' to the session log (or archive).\n> 2. Add today's changes to 'Recent Changes'.\n> 3. Update 'Current Focus' for the next session based on what we finished.\n> 4. Update `.ai/todo.md` marking completed tasks.\"\n\n### 🏗 Making Architectural Decisions\n**Prompt:**\n> \"I need to make a decision about [Topic]. Please review `.ai/decisions.md` to see our history, then propose options with pros/cons following the project's architectural guidelines.\"\n\n## Workflow Checklist\n\n1.  **Context Loading**: Always have the AI read `context.md` first.\n2.  **Task Selection**: Pick a task from `todo.md`.\n3.  **Implementation**: Work on the code, adhering to patterns in `context.md` (Notes for AI).\n4.  **Documentation**: If you change how something works, ask the AI to update the relevant `context.md` section.\n5.  **Logging**: Update `decisions.md` if a major choice is made.\n\n## Tips for Maintaining Context\n\n*   **Be Specific in `context.md`**: Don't just say \"Fix bugs\". Say \"Fix race condition in OrderController\".\n*   **Keep it Updated**: If the AI is confused, it's usually because `context.md` is outdated.\n*   **Use the `sessions/` folder**: If `context.md` gets too long (over 500 lines), move old \"Recent Changes\" to a file in `sessions/` to keep the main context lightweight.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n*   **\"The AI forgot we changed X\"**: You probably didn't update `context.md` at the end of the last session. Add it now.\n*   **\"The AI is writing code in the wrong style\"**: Point it to the \"Notes for AI\" section in `context.md`.\nContent from @reference/.ai/context.md:\n# Project Context\n\n## Current Focus\n*   **Status**: Initial Context Setup\n*   **Goal**: Establishing the AI context management system.\n*   **Next Steps**: \n    *   [ ] Verify .ai directory structure.\n    *   [ ] Begin working on high-priority backlog items (Check `.ai/todo.md`).\n\n## Project Overview\n*   **Type**: Repair Shop Management System (SaaS/Internal Tool).\n*   **Architecture**: Monorepo-style with separated Backend (Django) and Frontend (Next.js).\n*   **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose, PostgreSQL.\n\n### Tech Stack\n*   **Backend**: \n    *   Django & Django REST Framework (DRF).\n    *   Authentication: JWT (SimpleJWT).\n    *   Apps: `accounts`, `repairs`, `tech`.\n    *   Convention: SOLID principles. Models, serializers, and views are in **subdirectories**, not single files (e.g., `apps/accounts/models/user.py`, not `apps/accounts/models.py`).\n*   **Frontend**: \n    *   Next.js 14+ (App Router).\n    *   TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.\n    *   State Management: Zustand.\n    *   Path Aliases: `@/` pointing to `src/`.\n\n## Recent Changes\n| Date | Change Description | Files Modified | Next Steps |\n|------|-------------------|----------------|------------|\n| 2025-12-26 | Initialized AI Context System | `.ai/*` | Start using the system |\n\n*(Keep only the last 5 sessions here. Archive older entries to `.ai/sessions/`)*\n\n## Known Issues\n### Backend\n*   *None currently logged.*\n\n### Frontend\n*   *None currently logged.*\n\n### Deployment/DevOps\n*   *None currently logged.*\n\n## TODO Summary\n*   *See `.ai/todo.md` for the full list.*\n*   **Critical**: N/A\n*   **High**: N/A\n\n## Quick Reference\n*   **Backend Root**: `./backend`\n*   **Frontend Root**: `./frontend`\n*   **Run Dev**: `docker-compose up`\n*   **Frontend Types**: `frontend/src/types/`\n*   **Frontend Store**: `frontend/src/store/`\n*   **Django Settings**: `backend/conf/settings.py`\n\n## Notes for AI\n### Backend (Django) Rules\n1.  **Strict Separation**: Do not put all models in `models.py`. Use the `apps/<app_name>/models/` directory. Same for views and serializers.\n2.  **Imports**: Use absolute imports (e.g., `from apps.accounts.models import User`).\n3.  **Auth**: Respect JWT flow.\n\n### Frontend (Next.js) Rules\n1.  **Structure**: Pages in `src/app`. Components in `src/components`.\n2.  **Components**: Use `src/components/ui` for generic UI (shadcn). Use `src/components/<feature>` for domain components.\n3.  **State**: Prefer server components for data fetching. Use Zustand (`src/store`) for global client state.\n4.  **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes.\nContent from @reference/.ai/decisions.md:\n# Architectural Decisions Log\n\n## Template\n### [YYYY-MM-DD] Title of Decision\n*   **Context**: Why was this decision needed?

managing technical repairs and client services. It features a Django-based backend providing a REST API and a Next.js frontend for the user interface. The system includes authentication, role-based access, and search capabilities.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n### Backend\n* **Framework**: Django 5.2.4\n* **API**: Django REST Framework (DRF)\n* **Database**: PostgreSQL 16\n* **Search**: Elasticsearch 8.17 (via `django-elasticsearch-dsl`)\n* **Authentication**:\n  * `dj-rest-auth` & `django-allauth`\n  * JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Cookie support (`dj-rest-auth`, `simplejwt`)\n  * Social Auth (Google, Facebook)\n* **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 via `drf-spectacular`\n* **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose\n\n### Frontend\n* **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)\n* **Language**: TypeScript\n* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4\n* **UI Components**: Shadcn UI (Radix UI primitives)\n* **State Management**: Zustand, React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)\n* **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation\n* **HTTP Client**: Axios for API requests with automatic token refresh\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Backend Structure (`/backend`)\nThe backend follows a modular Django app structure located in `backend/apps/`:\n* **`accounts`**: User management, authentication, and profiles.\n* **`tech`**: Handles technical inventory, devices, products, brands, models, locations, suppliers, stock items, and store orders.\n* **`repairs`**: Core logic for managing repair tickets and workflows, including issues and repair status management.\n\n**Key Configurations**:\n* Settings managed via `django-environ`.\n* I18N enabled (French default).\n* CORS configured for frontend interaction.\n\n### Frontend Structure (`/frontend`)\nThe frontend uses the Next.js App Router:\n* **`app/`**: Next.js app router pages including authentication and dashboard routes\n* **`components/`**: Reusable UI components\n* **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for API interaction\n* **`lib/`**: Helper functions and utilities including API client configuration\n* **`services/`**: API client and service layers\n* **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions\n* **`store/`**: Zustand stores for global state management\n* **`contexts/`**: React context providers\n\n## Development Environment\n* **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates `db` (Postgres), `backend` (Django), and `frontend` (Next.js).\n* **Makefile**: Provides shortcuts for common tasks:\n  * `make init-backend` - Initialize backend with migrations and applies them\n  * `make migrate` - Create and apply database migrations\n  * `make createsuperuser` - Create Django superuser\n  * `make load-clients-data` - Load client data\n  * `make load-reparations-data` - Load reparation data\n  * `make generate-test-data` - Generate test data\n  * `make venv` - Create virtual environment and install dependencies\n  * `make clean` - Clean virtual environment\n\n## Key Features\n* **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup with JWT and social providers.\n* **Repair Tracking**: Management of repair lifecycle with multiple statuses (saisie, en-cours, prete, en-attente).\n* **Inventory Management**: Managing products, brands, models, locations, suppliers, stock items and store orders.\n* **Client Management**: Specialized data loading for clients.\n* **Search**: Full-text search capabilities using Elasticsearch.\n\n## Backend Models Status\n\n**Note**: The gap_analysis.md document is OUTDATED. All models and APIs mentioned below are actually IMPLEMENTED in the backend:\n\n### Tech App Models\n* **Brand**: Represents product brands with device type associations\n* **Series**: Product series under brands\n* **ProductModel**: Device models within series\n* **Product**: Individual products with pricing (retail, repair, special, other)\n* **DeviceType**: Categories like smartphones, tablets, computers\n* **Location**: Physical locations for inventory management\n* **Supplier**: Vendor information for procurement\n* **StockItem**: Inventory tracking linking products to locations\n* **StoreOrder**: Purchase orders from suppliers\n\n### Repairs App Models\n* **Repair**: Complete repair record with client, product model, status, pricing, and description\n* **Issue**: Defects or problems in repairs with device type associations\n\n### Accounts App Models\n* **User**: Custom user model extending AbstractUser\n* **Profile**: Extended user profile information\n* **EmailVerificationCode**: For email verification flow\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n### Tech Endpoints\n* `/api/tech/products/` - Product management (ProductViewSet)\n* `/api/tech/brands/` - Brand management (BrandViewSet)\n* `/api/tech/product-models/` - Product model management (ProductModelViewSet)\n* `/api/tech/locations/` - Location management (LocationViewSet)\n* `/api/tech/suppliers/` - Supplier management (SupplierViewSet)\n* `/api/tech/stock-items/` - Stock item management (StockItemViewSet)\n* `/api/tech/store-orders/` - Store order management (StoreOrderViewSet)\n* `/api/tech/device-types/` - Device type management (DeviceTypeViewSet)\n\n### Repairs Endpoints\n* `/api/repairs/repairs/` - Repair record management (RepairViewSet)\n* `/api/repairs/issues/` - Issue management (IssueViewSet)\n\n### Auth Endpoints\n* `/api/auth/` - Standard auth endpoints from dj-rest-auth\n* `/api/auth/login/` - Custom mobile login view\n* `/api/` - Account management endpoints\n\n## Frontend Hooks\n\nThe frontend provides React Query hooks for all backend endpoints:\n* `useProducts`, `useBrands`, `useProductModels`, `useDeviceTypes`\n* `useInventoryLocations`, `useSuppliers`, `useStockItems`, `useStoreOrders`\n* `useRepairs`, `useClients`, `useAuth`\n* and more specific hooks for different use cases\n\n## Docker Services\n\nThe project uses Docker Compose with the following services:\n- **db**: PostgreSQL 16 database\n- **backend**: Django server running on port 8000\n- **frontend**: Next.js application running on port 5173\n- **elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch service for search capabilities\n\n## Development Commands\n\n- `make init-backend` - Initialize backend with migrations and applies them\n- `make migrate` - Create and apply database migrations\n- `make createsuperuser` - Create Django superuser\n- `make load-clients-data` - Load client data\n- `make load-reparations-data` - Load reparation data\n- `make generate-test-data` - Generate test data\n- `make venv` - Create virtual environment and install dependencies\n- `make clean` - Clean virtual environment\n\n## Environment Variables Management\n- Environment variables are managed through `.envs/.local/` directory with separate files for database, server, and client configurations.\n\n## Important Files and Directories\n- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker orchestration configuration\n- `Makefile` - Contains development commands\n- `FRONTEND_ROADMAP.md` - Frontend development roadmap\n- `gap_analysis.md` - **OUTDATED** Analysis of backend-frontend gaps (all mentioned

is a multi-step form wizard that allows users to create repair orders for electronic devices. The process is divided into three main steps: Device selection, Issues identification, and Client information.\n\n## Frontend Architecture\n\n### Directory Structure\n```\nfrontend/\n└── src/\n    ├── app/\n    │   └── (dashboard)/\n    │       └── add-reparation/\n    │           ├── layout.tsx\n    │           ├── page.tsx\n    │           ├── device/\n    │           │   └── page.tsx\n    │           ├── issues/\n    │           │   └── page.tsx\n    │           └── client/\n    │               └── page.tsx\n    ├── components/\n    │   └── add-reparation/\n    │       └── client-step.tsx\n    ├── hooks/\n    │   ├── use-device-types.ts\n    │   ├── use-brands.ts\n    │   ├── use-product-models.ts\n    │   ├── use-common-issues.ts\n    │   └── use-clients.ts\n    ├── lib/\n    │   ├── api/client.ts\n    │   └── store.ts\n    ├── store/addReparationStore.ts\n    └── types/\n        ├── common.ts\n        └── product.ts\n```\n\n### Core Components\n\n#### 1. Layout (layout.tsx)\n- Provides the shared header with progress tracking\n- Shows a summary sidebar that updates as user progresses through steps\n- Manages state visualization for device type, brand, model, issues, and other details\n- Implements sticky sidebar with scroll behavior\n- Uses useReparationStore for state management\n- Fetches device types, brands, and models to display summary information\n\n#### 2. Main Page (page.tsx)\n- Simple redirect component that navigates to `/add-reparation/device` when accessed directly\n- Uses Next.js useRouter with useEffect for immediate redirection\n\n#### 3. Device Selection Step (device/page.tsx)\n- Allows users to select device type (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.)\n- Dynamically loads brands based on selected device type\n- Dynamically loads models based on selected brand\n- Uses shadcn/ui components: Card, Button, Popover, Command\n- Implements loading states with Loader2 icon\n- Uses API hooks for data fetching (useDeviceTypes, useBrands, useProductModels)\n- Includes client-side filtering for models based on brand\n- Handles disabled states during loading\n\n#### 4. Issues Identification Step (issues/page.tsx)\n- Displays common issues for the selected device type\n- Allows users to select multiple issues with visual feedback\n- Includes fields for detailed description, accessories, device password\n- Provides a date picker for scheduling\n- Uses Checkbox, Calendar, Textarea, Input from shadcn/ui\n- Uses useCommonIssues hook to fetch relevant issues\n- Implements deposit received toggle with Checkbox\n\n#### 5. Client Information Step (client/page.tsx)\n- Provides ClientStep component for handling client selection/creation\n- Allows searching existing clients using shadcn Command component or creating new ones\n- Integrates with the addReparationStore for form submission\n- Navigates to '/calendrier' after successful submission\n\n#### 6. ClientStep Component (components/add-reparation/client-step.tsx)\n- Complete client form with search and creation capabilities\n- Implements client search using shadcn/ui Popover with Command component (similar to device/brand/model selection)\n- Handles new client creation with validation\n- Uses separate form states for existing vs. new clients\n- Implements badge indicator for completion status\n- Provides submitForm method that integrates with useAddReparationStore\n- **Imports**: Button, Input, Label, Check, Search, ChevronRight, Badge, ChevronsUpDown from shadcn/ui, and Popover, PopoverContent, PopoverTrigger, Command, CommandEmpty, CommandGroup, CommandInput, CommandItem, CommandList\n- **Components**: Uses Popover with PopoverTrigger and PopoverContent containing Command, CommandInput, CommandList, CommandItem, CommandGroup, and CommandEmpty for client selection\n- Filters backend API calls to only fetch users with \"Client\" profile type\n- Properly handles client selection from the command list with search and filtering\n- Uses combobox pattern with visual indicator (ChevronsUpDown)\n\n### State Management\n\n#### useReparationStore (lib/store.ts)\n- Manages transient data during the wizard flow\n- Uses zustand for state management\n- **State Properties**:\n  -

REST API calls using Axios with proper error handling\n2. Consistent data mapping between frontend state and backend models\n3. URL-friendly slugs and primary keys for efficient lookups\n4. Validation at both frontend and backend levels\n5. Proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms\n6. Type safety with shared TypeScript interfaces\n\n## Form Submission Flow\n\n1. User completes all three steps in the wizard\n2. ClientStep calls useAddReparationStore.submitForm() after syncing data from useReparationStore:\n   - Maps issue names to IDs using the useCommonIssues hook\n   - Converts device type slug to numeric ID using device types lookup\n   - Formats accessories from string to array\n   - Converts date formats as needed\n3. submitForm() checks for existing client:\n   - If no existing client but has new client data, creates new user via POST /api/accounts/users/\n   - Uses the client (existing or new) for repair creation\n4. Creates unique repair UID (REP + timestamp)\n5. Makes POST /api/repairs/repairs/ with complete repair data including issue_ids and scheduled_date\n6. On success, invalidates query cache for [\"repairs\", \"clients\"] to refresh data\n7. Redirects to '/calendrier' and resets form state\n\n## Calendar Integration\n\n### Calendar Page Implementation\n- **Layout**: Uses sidebar layout for repair details (same as repairs page) instead of modal sheet\n- **Data**: Fetches real repair data using useRepairs hook instead of mock data\n- **Filtering**: Shows only repairs with scheduled dates\n- **Components**: Uses RepairDetails component directly in a right sidebar\n- **Actions**: Supports status changes, scheduling, payment processing, and recovery marking\n- **UI Pattern**: Consistent with repairs page for better user experience\n\n### Scheduled Date Handling\n- **Backend Model**: Added scheduled_date field to Repair model (nullable DateField)\n- **Serializer**: Maps frontend scheduledDate to backend scheduled_date field\n- **Data Flow**: Scheduled date from useReparationStore is properly synced to useAddReparationStore\n- **Format**: Dates are formatted to YYYY-MM-DD ISO string format\n- **Test Data**: generate_test_data.py includes scheduled dates for ~30% of repairs\n\n## Client Management Enhancements\n\n### Profile Type Filtering\n- **API**: useClients hook supports profileType parameter to filter users by role\n- **Backend**: Users endpoint supports role_name filtering to fetch specific user types\n- **Frontend**: Only \"Client\" profile type users are shown in selection\n- **Default**: \"Client\" profile type is selected in useClients hook call\n\n### Command Component Implementation\n- **Pattern**: Uses shadcn Popover + Command pattern (similar to device/brand/model selection)\n- **Components**: Popover, PopoverTrigger, PopoverContent with nested Command, CommandInput, CommandList, CommandItem, CommandGroup\n- **UI**: Provides search functionality with dropdown-like behavior\n- **Accessibility**: Includes ChevronsUpDown indicator for combobox pattern\n\n## Data Synchronization Between Stores\n\n### Store Integration\n- **useReparationStore**: Temporary data collection during form steps (deviceType, brand, model as slugs/IDs, issues as names)\n- **useAddReparationStore**: Final submission store (expects numeric IDs for backend)\n- **Sync Process**: Client-step maps data between stores before form submission\n  - Maps device type slug to numeric ID using device types lookup\n  - Maps issue names to IDs using useCommonIssues hook data\n  - Converts string IDs to numbers using parseInt\n  - Formats accessories from string to array\n\n## Cache Invalidation\n\n### React Query Integration\n- **Component**: useQueryClient hook used in client-step for cache management\n- **Invalidation**: After successful repair creation, invalidates [\"repairs\"] and [\"clients\"] query keys\n- **Effect**: Ensures calendar and other pages show fresh data without requiring page refresh\n- **User Experience**: New repairs appear immediately in calendar view\n\n## Database Migration Requirements\n\n### Required Migrations\n- **Model Change**: New scheduled_date field added to Repair model requires database migration\n- **Command**: `python manage.py makemigrations` followed by `python manage.py migrate` needed to update database schema\n- **Compatibility**: Without migration, the field will cause 400 validation errors when saving repairs\n- **Test Data**: Updated generate_test_data.py to include scheduled dates in new repair generation\nContent from @reference/docs/repairs/details-panel.prompt.yml:\n# Repair Details Panel Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThe Repair Details Panel is a sidebar component that displays comprehensive information about a selected repair order.

I **did** delegate the task of analyzing the `@reference` project and documenting the observations to the `codebase_investigator` (acting as the `bmm-architect`).\n\nThe `codebase_investigator` successfully completed that task. Its output included a detailed `SummaryOfFindings`, `ExplorationTrace`, and `RelevantLocations`, which I then used to create the Architectural Decision Record (ADR) as you requested.\n\nThe last action that was cancelled was me attempting to create the basic project directories (`backend`, `frontend`, `.envs`) for `laicité-2.0`, which was the next step in the project initialization phase after the ADR was created.",
