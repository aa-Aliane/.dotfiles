Here is the proposed plan for **Observatoire de la Laïcité BFC v2.0**:\n\n### Proposed Plan\n\n**1. Technology Stack**\n*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (TypeScript) for speed, SEO, and modern performance.\n*   **UI Framework:** [FlyonUI](https://flyonui.com/) (Tailwind CSS-based) to utilize modern, responsive components like Bento Grids, Mega Menus, and accessible UI elements.\n*   **Content Management:** Markdown/MDX for news and documents, enabling easy updates and version control via the repository.\n\n**2. Key Features**\n*   **Modern News Hub:** A clean, grid-based layout for regional news, replacing the current blog-style sidebar.\n*   **Integrated Resource Library:** A searchable and filterable database for charters, reports, and official documents.\n*   **Regional Navigation:** Easy access to city-specific content (Auxerre, Besançon, Dijon, etc.) via a modern navigation bar.\n*   **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.\n\n**3. Implementation Steps**\n*   **Phase 1:** Initialize the Next.js project with FlyonUI and Tailwind configuration.\n*   **Phase 2:** Build the global UI shell (Navbar, Footer, Layout).\n*   **Phase 3:** Set up the content pipeline for news and documentation.\n*   **Phase 4:** Develop the primary pages: Home, News Feed, and Document Archive.\n\n**Would you like me to proceed with this plan and begin the project initialization?**",
