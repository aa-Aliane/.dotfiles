Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

To avoid starting from scratch and potentially introducing \"AI slop\" or less-than-optimal architectural patterns, a decision was made to leverage an existing, high-quality reference project as a blueprint for the initial project setup. This reference project utilizes a similar technology stack (Docker, Django, Next.js) to the planned `laicité-2.0` implementation.\n\n## Decision\n\nThe `laicité-2.0` project will adopt the architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure observed in the provided reference project. This includes its approach to containerization with Docker Compose, configuration management using environment variables and `django-environ`, the structure of its Django backend, and its modern Next.js/React frontend setup.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe reference project provides an exemplary architectural foundation for a modern web application, embodying experienced, human-led architectural decisions. Its key strengths, making it an ideal starting point for `laicité-2.0`, are:\n\n1.  **Containerization & Orchestration:** The use of `docker-compose` facilitates a portable, single-command development environment, cleanly separating `db`, `backend`, and `frontend` services. This promotes consistency across development environments and simplifies deployment.\n2.  **Configuration Management:** The project demonstrates a best-practice approach by using `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` to inject environment-specific variables from a well-organized `.envs` directory. The Django backend then safely consumes these variables via `django-environ`, ensuring a clean separation of code and configuration and enhancing security.\n3.  **Robust Backend:** The Django backend is modular and well-structured, built for scalability and features. It includes pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and provides stubs for advanced components like full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n4.  **Modern Frontend:** The frontend stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript) is state-of-the-art. It utilizes TanStack React Query for sophisticated server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a productive UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui` principles. This ensures a modern, performant, and maintainable user interface.\n\nThis combination of industry-standard tools and proven patterns ensures `laicité-2.0` begins with a professional, scalable, and well-documented structure, significantly reducing initial setup time and architectural risks.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive\n\n*   **Accelerated Development:** A solid architectural foundation allows the team to focus on feature implementation rather than foundational setup.\n*   **Best Practices Adherence:** The project benefits from battle-tested patterns for containerization, configuration, and technology choices.\n*   **Improved Maintainability:** A well-defined and structured project is easier to understand, debug, and extend.\n*   **Scalability Potential:** The chosen technologies and patterns support future scaling of the application.\n*   **Reduced Risk:** Minimized architectural \"unknowns\" and common pitfalls.\n\n### Negative\n\n*   **Learning Curve:** Team members unfamiliar with specific tools or patterns used in the reference project (e.g., `django-environ`, TanStack React Query, `shadcn-ui`) may require an initial learning period.\n*   **Minor Adjustments:** While largely adopted, some specific configurations or features from the reference project may need minor adjustments to perfectly align with `laicité-2.0`'s unique requirements.\n*   **Hardcoded Password:** A minor flaw (hardcoded password in `settings.py` in the reference) must be addressed immediately during initialization to maintain security best practices.\nContent from @_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md:\n---\nstepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\ninputDocuments:\n  - \"/home/amine/coding/web/laicité-2.0/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief-laicité-2.0-2026-01-08.md\"\n  - \"/home/amine/coding/web/laicité-2.0/_bmad-output/prd.md\"\nworkflowType: 'architecture'\nproject_name: 'laicité-2.0'\nuser_name: 'Amine'\ndate: 'Thursday, January 8, 2026'\nlastStep: 6\n---\n\n# Architecture Decision Document\n\n_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe 41 identified Functional Requirements (FRs) comprehensively cover the core capabilities for `laicité-2.0`. These FRs primarily focus on content presentation and discovery (articles, events, documents, press reviews, search, filtering), as well as a dedicated Content Management System (CMS) for staff. All identified FRs are considered essential for the MVP, forming the \"capability contract\" for downstream work.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nThe following NFRs are critical architectural drivers:\n\n*   **Performance:** Requires fast loading times (core pages < 2s, search results < 1s) and optimized image delivery, necessitating efficient data retrieval, caching strategies, and optimized asset handling.\n*   **Security:** Demands robust authentication (MFA for staff), comprehensive data encryption (at rest and in transit), and fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) for CMS functionalities.\n*   **Scalability:** The architecture must accommodate a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over 24 months without significant performance degradation, implying horizontal scaling capabilities and stateless component design.\n*   **Accessibility:** Strict adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards is a non-negotiable requirement, influencing UI component selection, semantic structuring, and testing practices.\n*   **Reliability:** The system requires 99.9% uptime and robust data backup/restore mechanisms to ensure continuous availability.\n*   **Maintainability:** As a solo-developer project, the codebase must be clean, modular, well-documented, and easy to deploy and update to minimize operational overhead and prevent project failure due to complexity.\n*   **Integration:** The system needs to support basic calendar integration for events.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\n\n-   Primary domain: Full-stack Web Application\n-   Complexity level: **Medium (simple scope, high implementation quality bar)**. The project scope, centered around a content platform with CRUD operations and core discovery features, remains relatively simple. However, the demanding NFRs (performance, security, accessibility, scalability, and maintainability) elevate the implementation complexity, requiring robust architectural decisions and adherence to high quality standards.\n-   Estimated architectural components: (To be elaborated in subsequent architectural decision steps)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n*   **Core Technology Stack:** The architecture is constrained by the chosen stack: Next.js (frontend/SSR/SSG), Django (backend/API), and PostgreSQL (database), all orchestrated via Docker. This dictates the technology choices for components and deployment.\n*   **Deployment Environment:** Docker containerization implies a focus on container orchestration for deployment and management.\n*   **Solo Developer Model:** Architectural decisions must prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance to support efficient development and operational management by a single developer.\n*   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** The architecture must establish a flexible foundation that can seamlessly integrate user authentication in the future without requiring a major re-architecture. The choice of Django REST Framework and modular Next.js supports this.\n*   **Image Optimization Strategy:** While Next.js provides excellent image components, the backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage, considering options like local file storage versus cloud object storage (e.g., S3/Scaleway) for scalability and reliability.\n*   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** A critical technical requirement is to implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs to preserve SEO and ensure a smooth user transition. This will require a mapping and redirection mechanism within the application or at the proxy layer.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n*   **Security:** Encompasses authentication, authorization, and data protection across the entire system.\n*   **Performance:** Impacts user experience and SEO across all public-facing components.\n*   **Accessibility:** Must be integrated from the ground up into all UI and content presentation layers.\n*   **SEO:** Directly tied to content discoverability and requires careful architectural consideration for SSR/SSG, sitemaps, and metadata management.\n*   **Content Management:** The core mechanism for the Observatoire staff to maintain and update the platform's value.\n*   **Maintainability:** Essential for long-term project viability, especially with a solo development model.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack Web Application (Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker) based on project requirements analysis.\n\n### Frontend Starter Selection\n\n*   **Selected Starter:** `create-next-app` (official Next.js CLI)\n*   **Rationale:** Provides the most up-to-date and minimal foundation for Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript. This allows for precise integration of preferred frontend libraries (Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod, Shadcn UI, Framer Motion) without unnecessary boilerplate.\n\n**Initialization Command (Frontend - to be executed in `/frontend` directory):**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest . --typescript\n```\n\n**Key Architectural Decisions from Frontend Starter:**\n\n*   **Language & Runtime:** TypeScript for Next.js.\n*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router.\n*   **Styling Solution:** Initial setup allows for integration of Vanilla CSS with BEM methodology using Shadcn UI.\n*   **Build Tooling:** Next.js integrated build system.\n*   **Code Organization:** Standard Next.js App Router project structure.\n\n### Backend Setup Approach\n\n*   **Selected Approach:** Manual Django project initialization with `django-admin startproject`.\n*   **Rationale:** Provides maximum control over project structure and dependencies, allows for precise integration of required libraries (Django REST Framework, django-allauth, dj-rest-auth), and avoids unwanted boilerplate from external starter templates. This approach leverages proven patterns from a reference project while maintaining adherence to the specific architectural decisions made for `laicité-2.0`.\n\n**Initialization Steps (Backend - to be executed in `/backend` directory):**\n\n```bash\ncd backend/\ndjango-admin startproject laicite_config .\n# Followed by manual configuration of dependencies, settings, Docker, and project structure\n# leveraging patterns from a private reference repository.\n```\n\n**Key Architectural Decisions from Backend Setup:**\n\n*   **Language & Runtime:** Python for Django 5.x.\n*   **Framework:** Django with Django REST Framework.\n   **Database:** PostgreSQL integration.\n*   **Authentication:** Token-based authentication using `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` (with MFA support for staff).\n*   **API Documentation:** Automated API documentation (to be integrated manually).\n*   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose setup (to be configured manually).\n\n### Full-Stack Docker Compose Integration Strategy\n\nThis section outlines how to integrate the independently generated Next.js frontend and Django backend into a cohesive development and deployment environment using Docker Compose, adhering to your monorepo and VPS deployment preferences.\n\n**Monorepo Structure (Target):**\n\n```\n/project-root\n├── frontend/  (Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript)\n├── backend/   (Django 5.x + DRF)\n└── docker-compose.dev.yml\n└── docker-compose.prod.yml\n└── nginx/ (for production reverse proxy)\n```\n\n**Development (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) Goals:**\n\n*   **Frontend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Next.js development server.\n    *   `ports`: Expose Next.js dev server (e.g., `3000:3000`).\n    *   `volumes`: Mount local frontend code for hot reload.\n    *   `environment`: Point Next.js to the backend API (`http://backend:8000` within Docker network).\n*   **Backend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Django development server.\n    *   `ports`: Expose Django dev server (e.g., `8000:8000`).\n    *   `volumes`: Mount local backend code for hot reload.\n    *   `environment`: Configure Django to use the PostgreSQL service.\n*   **Database Service:**\n    *   `image`: PostgreSQL 16+ Docker image.\n    *   `volumes`: Persistent volume for data.\n    *   `environment`: Database credentials.\n*   **Hot Reloading:** Leverage Docker volumes and framework-specific HMR/auto-reloading for instant reflection of code changes.\n*   **API Communication:** Frontend communicates with backend service via internal Docker network name (`http://backend:8000`).\n\n**Production (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) Goals:**\n\n*   **Frontend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Next.js production build (`next build`).\n    *   `command`: Start Next.js production server (`next start`).\n*   **Backend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Django production build (e.g., collectstatic).\n    *   `command`: Start Gunicorn/Uvicorn for Django.\n*   **Database Service:** Same as development, but with robust backup strategy.\n*   **Nginx Service:**\n    *   `build`: Custom Nginx configuration (from `nginx/nginx.conf`).\n    *   `ports`: Expose `80:80`, `443:443`.\n    *   `volumes`: Mount static files, media files, and `nginx.conf`.\n    *   `depends_on`: Frontend and Backend services.\n    *   **Role:** Act as reverse proxy, serve static assets, handle SSL termination.\n*   **Volume Management:** Persistent volumes for PostgreSQL data, Django media files.\n\n**Development Workflow Features (to be integrated):**\n\n*   **ESLint + Prettier:** To be integrated into both frontend (`package.json` scripts) and backend (`pyproject.toml` for Python linting).\n*   **Git Hooks (Pre-commit):** A `pre-commit` framework (like `husky` for JS or `pre-commit` for Python) will be configured to run linting and type checks automatically.\n*   **Basic CI/CD Skeleton:** A GitHub Actions (or similar) workflow will be outlined for automated testing and deployment to the VPS.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n*   **Authentication System:** Using `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for robust and future-proof token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n*   **Authorization Pattern:** Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):\n*   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach - application-level caching (TanStack Query, Next.js, Django view/lru_cache) initially, with a migration path to Redis if needed.\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n*   None explicitly deferred in these categories yet.\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n*   **Decision:** Hybrid Caching Strategy\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Initial Approach (MVP):**\n        *   **Frontend Caching:** TanStack Query for client-side data fetching and caching; Next.js built-in caching (ISR, SSG) and Image Optimization.\n        *   **Backend Caching:** Django's view-level caching using decorators for frequently accessed endpoints; Database query optimization (indexing, `select_related`, `prefetch_related`); `functools.lru_cache` for expensive computations.\n    *   **Rationale:** Prioritizes simplicity, aligns with solo-developer model, leverages existing tech stack, measures performance before adding complexity.\n    *   **Future Migration Path:** If profiling reveals bottlenecks, introduce Redis for API response caching, session storage, full-page caching, and rate limiting.\n*   **Affects:** Frontend performance, Backend performance, Database load.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n*   **Decision:** Authentication System (Update)\n*   **Details:** Replaced `django-rest-knox` with `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth`.\n    *   **Rationale:** More robust, battle-tested, comprehensive MFA support, better documentation, handles email verification/password reset, future-proof for general user authentication, better integration with DRF.\n*   **Affects:** Backend authentication implementation, overall security posture.\n\n*   **Decision:** Authorization Pattern for CMS\n*   **Details:** Django's built-in permissions and groups, with custom permissions defined in model Meta classes as needed.\n    *   **Rationale:** Meets MVP RBAC needs for CMS staff (Editor, Admin, Contributor roles), leverages existing Django features, simple and maintainable for solo developer, avoids unnecessary complexity of object_level permissions for MVP.\n*   **Affects:** Backend authorization, CMS functionalities, staff access control.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\nMultiple areas where AI agents could make different choices if not explicitly defined, including naming conventions across database, API, and code, various structural patterns, data format conventions, and communication/process patterns.\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n*   **Table names:** `plural_snake_case` (e.g., `articles`, `press_reviews`, `event_categories`)\n*   **Column names:** `singular_snake_case` (e.g., `created_at`, `author_name`, `is_published`)\n*   **Primary keys:** `id` (Django default)\n*   **Foreign keys:** `{model_name}_id` (e.g., `author_id`, `category_id`)\n*   **Junction tables:** `{model1}_{model2}` (e.g., `articles_tags`)\n*   **Rationale:** Aligns with Django ORM and Python ecosystem, adheres to PostgreSQL best practices, allows for clean frontend-backend casing transformation at API serialization layer.\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n*   **URL Paths (Endpoints):** `kebab-case` (e.g., `/api/press-reviews/`, `/api/event-categories/`, `/api/search-results/`)\n*   **Query Parameters:** `snake_case` (e.g., `/api/articles?category_id=5&is_published=true`)\n*   **JSON Request/Response Bodies:** `snake_case` (e.g., `{ \"article_id\": 123, \"title\": \"Example\" }`)\n*   **HTTP Headers:** `Kebab-Case` (e.g., `Content-Type`, `X-API-Version`)\n*   **Frontend Transformation:** Frontend will handle `snake_case` to `camelCase` transformation in the data-fetching layer (e.g., using TanStack Query's `select` option or utility functions).\n*   **Rationale:** Web standard URLs, consistency with backend/database, simpler backend implementation, frontend flexibility, clear separation of concerns.\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n*   **Backend (Python/Django) - PEP 8 Conventions:**\n    *   Files: `snake_case` (e.g., `article_serializers.py`, `event_views.py`)\n    *   Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ArticleSerializer`, `EventViewSet`)\n    *   Functions/methods: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_published_articles()`, `calculate_reading_time()`)\n    *   Variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `article_count`, `is_published`, `created_at`)\n    *   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`)\n*   **Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js/React) - JavaScript/TypeScript Conventions:**\n    *   Files: `kebab-case` for pages/components (e.g., `article-card.tsx`, `event-list.tsx`, `use-articles.ts`)\n    *   React Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ArticleCard`, `EventList`)\n    *   Functions/hooks: `camelCase` (e.g., `formatDate()`, `useArticles()`)\n    *   Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `articleCount`, `isPublished`, `createdAt`)\n    *   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` or `camelCase` (both common)\n    *   Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ArticleCardProps`, `EventCategory`)\n    *   CSS Classes: BEM with `kebab-case` (e.g., `.article-card`, `.article-card__title`)\n*   **Rationale:** Leverages existing ecosystem knowledge, improves readability and maintainability within each codebase.\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n*   **Monorepo Structure:** `/project-root` containing `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `nginx/`. (Reconfirmed from Starter Template Evaluation)\n*   **Frontend:** Standard Next.js App Router project structure.\n*   **Backend:** Standard Django project structure with apps like `cms/`, `content/`, `search/`.\n*   **Tests:** Co-located with code where appropriate, or in a dedicated `tests/` directory within each app/module.\n*   **Shared Utilities/Types:** Centralized in a designated `lib/` or `types/` folder in the frontend, and shared utility modules in the backend.\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n*   Configuration files: Standard locations (`.env`, `next.config.ts`, `settings.py`).\n*   Static assets: `public/` in frontend, `static/` in backend apps.\n*   Documentation: `docs/` or within relevant sections.\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Data Transformation Strategy:**\n*   **Decision:** Backend Serializer Transformation.\n*   **Details:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and `camelCase` to `snake_case` for API requests.\n*   **Rationale:** Creates a clear `camelCase` API contract, simplifies frontend, improves type safety, enhances reusability for other API consumers, easier API contract testing. Implementation via a base serializer class with conversion methods.\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n*   **Decision:** Hybrid API Response Format Strategy.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Simple Endpoints (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH for single resources):** Direct data return.\n    *   **Collection/List Endpoints (with pagination, filtering, metadata):** Standardized wrapper `{ \"data\": [...], \"meta\": { pagination: ... } }`.\n    *   **Search/Complex Queries:** Wrapper `{ \"data\": { ... }, \"meta\": { query: ..., totalResults: ... } }`.\n    *   **Error Responses:** Always wrapped `{ \"error\": { code: ..., message: ..., details: ... } }`.\n    *   **DELETE Operations:** `204 No Content` or `{ \"success\": true }`.\n*   **Rationale:** Pragmatic, avoids unnecessary complexity, aligns with DRF defaults, extensible, frontend-friendly, clear decision rules.\n\n**Standardized Error Response Structure:**\n*   **Decision:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n*   **Details:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"error\": {\n        \"code\": \"VALIDATION_ERROR\",\n        \"message\": \"Invalid input data\",\n        \"details\": { /* optional: granular info, e.g., field errors */ },\n        \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-08T10:30:45Z\", /* optional but recommended */\n        \"path\": \"/api/articles\" /* optional but recommended */\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    *   **Environment-Specific:** `exception` and `stackTrace` included in `details` only during development.\n*   **Rationale:** Provides machine-readable codes for frontend logic, human-readable messages for users/debugging, granular details for validation, and aids debugging with timestamps/paths. Production readiness, developer experience.\n*   **Implementation:** Custom DRF exception handler on the backend. Frontend handles with TanStack Query's `onError` and conditional logic.\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**Inter-Service Communication (Backend):**\n*   **Decision:** Follow a \"You Aren't Gonna Need It\" (YAGNI) principle for backend inter-service communication.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Initial Approach (MVP):** Direct function calls between Django apps, direct ORM access, and Django signals for decoupled event handling (e.g., `post_save` for notifications).\n    *   **When to Add Celery/Redis:** Only when specific scenarios (bulk emails, long-running data processing, external API calls, scheduled tasks) necessitate it.\n    *   **Future Migration Path:** Add Redis to `docker-compose.yml`, install Celery/`django-celery-beat`, convert slow operations to Celery tasks.\n*   **Rationale:** Zero infrastructure overhead for MVP, simple debugging, fast development, sufficient for MVP, avoids over-engineering, supports solo-developer model.\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling:** (Covered by Standardized Error Response Structure)\n**Loading States:** (Will be covered during Frontend implementation, likely via TanStack Query's `isLoading`/`isFetching` and local `useState` for UI components).\n**Authentication Flow:** (Handled by `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` on backend, integrated on frontend with TanStack Query for API calls).\n**Validation:** (Zod + React Hook Form on frontend, Django Forms/Serializers on backend).\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n*   Adhere to defined naming conventions for database, API, and code.\n*   Utilize the specified project and file structures.\n*   Follow the API data transformation and response format strategies.\n*   Implement error handling according to the standardized error response structure.\n*   Employ the agreed-upon inter-service communication patterns.\n*   Utilize TanStack Query for server state and Zustand for client UI state in the frontend.\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n*   Automated linting and type checking via CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for code naming and structure.\n*   Code reviews to ensure adherence to API, database, and architectural patterns.\n*   API documentation (generated by DRF) to serve as a single source of truth for API contracts.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**Hosting Strategy:**\n*   **Decision:** Initial deployment to a 20GB Virtual Private Server (VPS).\n*   **Resource Allocation (Initial):** 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM, 20GB SSD, 500GB bandwidth/month.\n*   **Rationale:** Cost-effective, sufficient for 5+ years at current growth rate, avoids over-provisioning, aligns with solo-developer model.\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline Approach:**\n*   **Decision:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n*   **Stages & Tools:**\n    *   **Lint:** Frontend (ESLint + Prettier), Backend (Black + Flake8 + isort).\n    *   **Type Check:** Frontend (TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`), Backend (mypy - optional).\n    *   **Test:** Frontend (Jest + React Testing Library), Backend (pytest with coverage against PostgreSQL container).\n    *   **Build:** Build Docker images for frontend/backend, push to GitHub Container Registry.\n    *   **Deploy:** SSH into VPS, pull latest images, `docker-compose up -d`, run migrations/collectstatic, health check (only on `main` branch).\n*   **Branch Strategy:** `main` for auto-deploy, `develop` for tests only, feature branches for lint/test only, PRs for full pipeline.\n*   **Rationale:** Balances automation and simplicity, integrated with GitHub, cost-effective (free tier), catches bugs early, ensures consistent and reliable deployments, provides an audit trail.\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\n/project-root\n├── .gemini/\n├── _bmad/\n├── _bmad-output/\n├── client_expression.md\n├── docker-compose.dev.yml\n├── docker-compose.prod.yml\n├── Makefile\n├── nginx/\n│   └── nginx.conf\n├── frontend/\n│   ├── .env\n│   ├── .env.example\n│   ├── package.json\n│   ├── package-lock.json\n│   ├── next.config.ts\n│   ├── tsconfig.json\n│   ├── biome.json\n│   ├── public/\n│   │   └── assets/ (images, icons)\n│   ├── src/\n│   │   ├── app/ (Next.js App Router)\n│   │   │   ├── (auth)/ (route group for auth-related pages)\n│   │   │   ├── (main)/ (route group for main application pages)\n│   │   │   ├── globals.css\n│   │   │   ├── layout.tsx\n│   │   │   └── page.tsx\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   │   ├── ui/ (Shadcn UI components)\n│   │   │   ├── features/ (e.g., articles/ArticleCard, events/EventList)\n│   │   │   └── auth/ (LoginForm, SignupForm)\n│   │   ├── lib/\n│   │   │   ├── api/ (TanStack Query client setup, API functions)\n│   │   │   ├── hooks/ (Custom React hooks)\n│   │   │   ├── utils/ (Utility functions)\n│   │   │   └── types/ (TypeScript type definitions and interfaces)\n│   │   ├── store/ (Zustand stores for client UI state)\n│   │   └── middleware.ts (Next.js middleware)\n│   └── tests/ (Jest, React Testing Library)\n├── backend/\n│   ├── .env\n│   ├── .env.example\n│   ├── manage.py\n│   ├── requirements.txt\n│   ├── Dockerfile\n│   ├── conda_environment.yaml\n│   ├── laicite_config/ (project settings, URLs, WSGI/ASGI)\n│   ├── cms/ (Django app for CMS functionalities)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── content/ (Django app for articles, events, documents)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── search/ (Django app for search)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── users/ (Django app for custom user model, allauth integration)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── notifications/ (Django app for notifications)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   └── core/ (shared backend utilities, custom exception handler, base serializers)\n```\n\n### Architectural Boundaries\n\n**API Boundaries:**\n*   **External API Endpoints:** Defined by DRF routes in `backend/laicite_config/urls.py` and individual app `urls.py` (e.g., `backend/content/urls.py`). All endpoints exposed under `/api/` (e.g., `/api/articles/`, `/api/press-reviews/`).\n*   **Authentication/Authorization Boundaries:** Handled by `backend/users/` app, integrated via DRF views and Django permissions system. Next.js middleware (`frontend/src/middleware.ts`) and API client (`frontend/src/lib/api/`) will manage token handling and authentication status on the client.\n*   **Data Access Layer Boundaries:** Django ORM provides the primary boundary between business logic and database. Direct ORM access is restricted to model managers and services within their respective Django apps.\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n*   **Frontend Component Communication:** Primarily props drilling for parent-child, Context API for global theme/locale, Zustand for client UI state, and TanStack Query for server state.\n*   **Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls and ORM access between Django apps for synchronous operations. Django signals for event-driven, decoupled communication.\n*   **Event-Driven Integration Points:** Django signals (backend) and potential custom event bus (frontend) for loose coupling between components/features.\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n*   **Database Schema:** Managed by Django models within each app (e.g., `backend/content/models.py`), enforced by migrations. PostgreSQL is the central data store.\n*   **Caching Boundaries:** TanStack Query cache on the frontend for server data. Django's view-level and `lru_cache` for backend performance, with clear boundaries on what data is cached and for how long.\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**Feature/Epic Mapping:**\n*   **Content Presentation (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews):**\n    *   Backend: `backend/content/` (models, views, serializers, admin), `backend/cms/` (admin customizations).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(main)/articles/`, `events/`, `documents/`, `press-reviews/` (pages), `frontend/src/components/features/` (e.g., `ArticleCard`, `EventList`), `frontend/src/lib/api/` (API calls for content).\n*   **Search and Filtering:**\n    *   Backend: `backend/search/` (views, serializers, search logic).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(main)/search/` (page), `frontend/src/components/features/search/` (search bar, filter components), `frontend/src/lib/api/` (API calls for search).\n*   **CMS Functionalities (for Staff):**\n    *   Backend: `backend/cms/` (admin, custom views, specific models), `backend/users/` (RBAC implementation).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/`, `frontend/src/app/(main)/admin/` (protected admin pages), `frontend/src/components/features/cms/`.\n*   **User Authentication (Future):**\n    *   Backend: `backend/users/` (allauth integration, custom user model).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/`, `signup/`, `reset-password/`, `frontend/src/components/auth/`.\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n*   **Security (Auth/Authz):** `backend/users/`, `frontend/src/middleware.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/api/`.\n*   **Performance (Caching):** `frontend/src/lib/api/` (TanStack Query), backend (Django view caching, `functools.lru_cache`).\n*   **Accessibility:** Frontend components in `frontend/src/components/ui/` and `features/`, enforced via linting.\n*   **SEO:** Next.js metadata API in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` and page-level layouts.\n*   **Maintainability:** Enforced by code naming conventions, CI/CD linting/formatting, clear project structure.\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n*   **Frontend:** TanStack Query for server state updates, Zustand for client UI state, React Context for themes.\n*   **Backend:** Direct function calls and ORM access between Django apps. Django signals for event-driven decoupling.\n*   **API:** All communication between frontend and backend via the REST API, using `camelCase` JSON bodies and `kebab-case` URLs.\n\n**External Integrations:**\n*   **Calendar Integration:** Dedicated service/module within `backend/content/` or `backend/integrations/` to interact with external calendar APIs. Frontend components in `frontend/src/components/features/events/`.\n*   **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image Component handles frontend optimization. Backend media storage via Django's file storage (local or cloud like S3/Scaleway if introduced).\n\n**Data Flow:**\n*   Frontend (React Components) -> (TanStack Query / React Hook Form / Zustand) -> (API client in `frontend/src/lib/api/`) -> Backend (DRF Views) -> (DRF Serializers) -> (Django Models/ORM) -> PostgreSQL.\n*   Data flows back in reverse, with DRF serializers transforming `snake_case` database data to `camelCase` API responses.\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n*   **Frontend:** `.env`, `.env.example`, `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `biome.json`.\n*   **Backend:** `.env`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`, `manage.py`, `backend/laicite_config/settings.py`.\n*   **Shared:** `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `nginx/nginx.conf`.\n\n**Source Organization:**\n*   **Frontend:** `src/` as the main source directory, further organized by App Router conventions (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `store/`, `types/`).\n*   **Backend:** Main project (`laicite_config/`) and individual Django apps (`cms/`, `content/`, etc.) each with their `models.py`, `views.py`, `serializers.py`, `admin.py`. Shared utilities in `backend/core/`.\n\n**Test Organization:**\n*   **Frontend:** `tests/` directory at the root of `frontend/` (or co-located with components for smaller tests).\n*   **Backend:** `tests/` directory within each Django app.\n*   **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` for automated testing.\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n*   **Frontend:** `frontend/public/assets/` for static images, fonts, and other public assets.\n*   **Backend:** Media files handled by Django's `MEDIA_ROOT` (local filesystem initially, cloud storage like S3/Scaleway if introduced).\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n*   `docker-compose.dev.yml` orchestrates frontend (Next.js dev server), backend (Django dev server), and PostgreSQL database. Mounted volumes for hot-reloading.\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n*   `Dockerfile` in `frontend/` and `backend/` define container images.\n*   GitHub Actions `build` stage handles `docker build` and `docker push` to GitHub Container Registry.\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n*   `docker-compose.prod.yml` defines the production deployment on the VPS, including Nginx as a reverse proxy.\n*   GitHub Actions `deploy` stage handles SSH into VPS, pulling images, running `docker-compose up -d`, migrations, and static file collection.\nContent from @_bmad-output/prd.md:\n---\nstepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ninputDocuments:\n  - \"/home/amine/coding/web/laicité-2.0/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief-laicité-2.0-2026-01-08.md\"\n  - \"/home/amine/coding/web/laicité-2.0/_bmad-output/analysis/brainstorming-session-2026-01-06.md\"\nworkflowType: 'prd'\nlastStep: 10\n---\n\n# Product Requirements Document - laicité-2.0\n\n**Author:** Amine\n**Date:** 2026-01-08\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe laicité-2.0 project aims to transform the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC's online presence into the primary, authoritative, and user-friendly hub for laïcité information in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region.

She's tried searching online before, but usually gets overwhelmed by national-level political debates or confusing legal jargon. She wants to understand what laïcité means for *her* community.\n**Goal:** Find clear, accessible information about laïcité principles and discover if there are any local initiatives or events in Dijon she could learn more from.\n**Obstacle:** Overwhelm from generic search results, difficulty discerning reliable local information, fear of misinterpreting complex topics.\n\n**Opening Scene:** Marie is at her kitchen table, phone in hand, feeling a familiar frustration after a quick Google search for \"laïcité Dijon\". The results are a mix of news articles, opinion pieces, and official-looking but hard-to-navigate government sites. She sighs, feeling no closer to understanding what's relevant to *her* daily life.\n\n**Rising Action:** A friend casually mentions the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC has a new website. Intrigued by the regional focus, Marie types \"observatoire laïcité BFC\" into her browser. She lands on the laicité-2.0 homepage. The design is clean and modern, immediately conveying professionalism. A prominent search bar catches her eye, but she first notices a \"Regions & Cities\" dropdown in the navigation.

An opposing council member cites an interpretation of a regional regulation that Madame Lambert believes is incorrect or outdated. She needs to quickly verify the official wording of the regulation to present a counter-argument and ensure an informed decision is made.\n**Goal:** Rapidly find and confirm the exact wording of a specific regional laïcité regulation or official guidance during a live, high-pressure situation.\n**Obstacle:** Time constraints, need for absolute accuracy and authority, inability to easily access official documents on the fly from mobile devices.\n\n**Opening Scene:** The municipal council meeting is tense. Madame Lambert listens as an opposing colleague, confident in their misinterpretation of a laïcité regulation, pushes for a decision she knows is flawed. Her heart rate quickens. She knows the official stance, but needs to present the exact wording, and quickly, before the debate spirals. Fumbling with her tablet, she recalls past frustrations trying to navigate obscure government portals.\n\n**Rising Action:** Remembering the Observatoire's new site, she quickly types \"observatoire laïcité BFC\" into her tablet's browser. The site loads almost instantly, even on the public Wi-Fi. The responsive design adapts perfectly to her tablet screen. She immediately navigates to the \"Documents\" section and uses the \"Regional Guidance\" filter, then refines her search by \"Dole\" (though she knows the regulation is regional, she wants to ensure no local amendments). She quickly types keywords from the regulation into the search bar. The results prioritize official documents, and the correct regulation appears at the top. She opens the PDF, which renders clearly on her tablet, and scrolls directly to the relevant section.\n\n**Climax:** With the official text displayed prominently on her tablet, Madame Lambert confidently interjects. \"With all due respect, my colleague, the official regional guidance on this matter, found on the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC website, states...\" She reads the precise wording, refuting the misinterpretation with undeniable authority. The room quiets, and the debate shifts towards an informed discussion. Her confidence, backed by credible, real-time access to information, changes the direction of the meeting.\n\n**Resolution:** The immediate crisis is averted, and a more accurate decision is made. Madame Lambert feels immense relief and pride. The laicité-2.0 platform has not only saved the day but has solidified her reputation as a meticulous and well-informed councilor. She realizes the site will be an essential tool for all her future work, transforming how she accesses and utilizes official information.\n\n---\n\n### Journey 4: Monsieur Jean-Luc Dubois - Empowered Content Publishing\n\n**User Type:** Association Staff (Content Publisher/Editor)\n**Persona:** Monsieur Jean-Luc Dubois, a dedicated volunteer for the Observatoire.\n**Situation:** Monsieur Dubois is tasked with publishing a new article about an upcoming laïcité awareness campaign in Besançon. In the past, this meant wrestling with the cumbersome and unintuitive WordPress backend, fighting with formatting, and spending hours ensuring correct categorization and tagging. He often hesitated to publish new content due to the sheer effort involved, leading to delays and missed opportunities for timely information dissemination.\n**Goal:** Efficiently publish a new article, including text, images, and proper categorization by city and topic, with minimal friction and confidence that it will be discoverable by the target audience.\n**Obstacle:** Complicated, non-intuitive content management system (CMS), time-consuming formatting, fear of making mistakes, and lack of clarity on how to ensure discoverability.\n\n**Opening Scene:** Monsieur Dubois sits down at his computer, a freshly written article open on one screen and the old WordPress admin login page on the other. He stares at the WordPress page with a familiar sense of dread, recalling past battles with unresponsive editors, lost changes, and baffling menus. He needs this important campaign article to go live today, but the thought of the publishing process drains his energy.\n\n**Rising Action:** Having heard about the new laicité-2.0 platform, he accesses the new, streamlined content management interface (which he can access via a secure link from the public site, or a dedicated admin URL). The interface is clean, modern, and intuitive, a stark contrast to the old system. He finds a prominent \"Create New Article\" button. The editor is a simple, visual Markdown-based interface, making formatting effortless. He easily uploads campaign images, which are automatically optimized. He quickly assigns the article to the \"Campaigns\" category, tags it with \"Besançon\" and \"Awareness,\" and even sees a preview of how it will look on the public site, both desktop and mobile. He sees clear fields for metadata that directly feed into search and filtering.\n\n**Climax:** With a few clicks, Monsieur Dubois reviews the article and clicks \"Publish.\" The system processes it swiftly, and he immediately receives a confirmation message and a direct link to the live article. He then navigates to the public site, filters by \"Besançon,\" and sees his new article proudly displayed, perfectly formatted and discoverable. The entire process took him under 15 minutes—a task that would have consumed over an hour (and his patience) on the old system.\n\n**Resolution:** Monsieur Dubois feels a surge of satisfaction and renewed motivation. The new CMS has completely transformed his role; he's no longer a \"WordPress wrestler\" but an efficient content publisher. He now actively looks for opportunities to create and upload new content, knowing the process is seamless and his efforts will genuinely reach the intended audience. He shares his positive experience with other volunteers, creating a positive feedback loop for content creation.\n\n---\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\nThese narrative journeys reveal the following critical capabilities required for laicité-2.0:\n\n*   **Public-Facing Interface (Frontend):**\n    *   Clean, modern, professional, and responsive design (desktop & mobile).\n    *   Intuitive main navigation.\n    *   Prominent and effective search bar with keyword matching and result prioritization.\n    *   Robust regional/city filtering for all content types (articles, events).\n    *   Clear, well-categorized display of articles, events, and documents with relevant metadata.\n    *   Direct and reliable document download functionality.\n    *   Calendar integration for events.\n    *   Content presentation in clear, accessible language, avoiding jargon where possible.\n    *   Ability to preview content on various devices.\n    *   Credibility and authority signals through design and content.\n\n*   **Content Management System (Backend/Admin Interface):**\n    *   Intuitive, clean, and modern backend interface for content creation and management.\n    *   User-friendly editor (e.g., Markdown-based).\n    *   Simple image upload and automatic optimization.\n    *   Clear categorization and tagging mechanisms (city, topic, campaign).\n    *   Live preview functionality (desktop and mobile).\n    *   Metadata management fields for discoverability (SEO).\n    *   Efficient content publishing workflow with swift processing and confirmation.\n    *   Secure, role-based access control.\n\n*   **Underlying Technical Capabilities:**\n    *   Fast loading times and optimized performance.\n    *   Reliable document storage and retrieval.\n    *   Robust search indexing (PostgreSQL FTS).\n    *   Modular and extensible architecture (Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL with Docker) to support future growth (e.g., authentication, advanced search).\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nLaicité-2.0 will be implemented as a modern web application, leveraging a **hybrid SPA/MPA approach** using Next.js App Router. This strategy ensures optimal performance and SEO while providing a dynamic user experience for interactive elements. The project is focused on \"liberating existing valuable content\" through modern UX, intuitive organization, and effective search.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\nThe application will primarily use:\n*   **Static Generation (SSG):** For stable content such as the homepage, \"About\" page, and core document sections, built at deploy time and served efficiently from a CDN. This optimizes load times and reduces server load for unchanging content.\n*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** For dynamic content including articles and events. Django will serve data to Next.js, which will render full HTML on the server. This ensures excellent SEO, fresh content delivery, and fast initial page loads.\n*   **Client-Side Interactivity:** Targeted use of client-side JavaScript for dynamic elements like search autocompletion, filter dropdowns, and smooth UI transitions (e.g., with Framer Motion). The application will implement **progressive enhancement**, ensuring core content access even without JavaScript.\n\n### Browser Support\n\nThe platform will target modern browser support, specifically the **last 2 major versions** of the following evergreen browsers:\n*   Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)\n*   Firefox\n*   Safari (iOS and macOS)\n*   Mobile browsers: iOS Safari and Chrome on Android (applying the same version policy).\n\nExplicitly **not supported** are Internet Explorer, highly obscure browsers, and browsers older than approximately two years. Testing will focus on primary development in Chrome, regular checks in Firefox/Safari, and periodic checks in Edge, supplemented by tools like BrowserStack.\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nThe application will be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless and optimal experience across all devices: mobile, tablet, and desktop. Design and development will prioritize a mobile-first approach.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\nFast loading times are a critical success factor, directly impacting user satisfaction and SEO. Performance will be optimized through:\n*   Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation.\n*   Optimized image delivery and lazy loading for media assets.\n*   Efficient backend query optimization.\n*   Adherence to Core Web Vitals to ensure rapid loading, interactivity, and visual stability.\n\n### SEO Strategy\n\nSEO is a fundamental requirement, directly addressing the core problem of content discoverability. Our strategy includes:\n*   **Full Crawlability:** SSR/SSG ensures search engines receive fully rendered HTML pages for all content.\n*   **Schema.org Markup:** Implementing structured data for `Article`, `Event`, and `Organization` schemas to enable rich results in search.\n*   **Clean URLs:** Designing user-friendly and SEO-optimized URL structures.\n*   **Automated XML Sitemap:** Ensuring all public content is discoverable by search engines.\n*   **Redirects:** Implementing proper 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs to preserve any existing domain authority.\n*   **Local SEO:** Creating city-specific landing pages or filtered views to capture regional search queries.\n*   **Content Optimization:** Semantic HTML, appropriate meta tags (title, description, Open Graph), and fast image loading.\n*   **Goal:** To dominate the laïcité information niche within the BFC region within 6 months post-launch, relying on credible, organic authority.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\nCompliance with **WCAG 2.1 AA** is the baseline, aligning with French RGAA standards for public service platforms. Accessibility is non-negotiable and will be integrated from the start.\n\n**Key Accessibility Commitments:**\n*   **Semantic HTML:** Strict adherence to proper heading hierarchy, semantic tags (`nav`, `main`, `article`), associated form labels, and correct button elements.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators and logical tab order. Implementation of skip links and modal focus trapping.\n*   **Screen Reader Support:** Comprehensive alt text for all images, appropriate ARIA labels, `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates (search results, filters), and proper landmark roles.\n*   **Color and Contrast:** Adherence to WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large), not relying on color alone for information conveyance.\n*   **Responsive & Flexible Design:** Text scaling up to 200% without breakage, no horizontal scrolling at 320px width, and appropriate touch target sizes.\n*   **Accessible Forms:** Clear labels, descriptive error messages, and accessible validation feedback.\n\n**Tools & Practices:**\n*   Leveraging Shadcn UI (built on Radix UI) for inherently accessible components.\n*   Automated testing with tools like axe DevTools, Lighthouse, and Pa11y in CI/CD.\n*   Manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).\n*   Consideration for `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations.\n*   An **Accessibility Statement** will be published on the site, detailing our commitment, known issues, and feedback channels.\n\n**Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP Accessibility:** Full RGAA audit/certification, sign language videos, audio descriptions for complex visual content, and support for ancient assistive technologies.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** This project embraces a **Problem-Solving MVP** philosophy. The core goal is to liberate existing valuable content from its current ineffective delivery system and present it in a discoverable, organized, and professional manner. The MVP will solve the primary user pain points related to information access and user experience with a focused, minimal set of features.\n\n**Resource Requirements:** The MVP is planned for execution by a **solo full-stack developer**, which streamlines coordination and decision-making, allowing for efficient development and iteration.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\nThe MVP is

navigation, screen reader support, contrast ratios, text scaling).\n*   **Content Management System (CMS - for Association Staff):**\n    *   Intuitive and clean backend interface for content creation and management.\n    *   User-friendly editor (e.g., Markdown-based).\n    *   Simple image upload and automatic optimization.\n    *   Clear categorization and tagging mechanisms (city, topic, campaign).\n    *   Live preview functionality (desktop and mobile).\n    *   Metadata management fields for discoverability (SEO).\n    *   Efficient content publishing workflow with swift processing and confirmation.\n    *   Secure, role-based access control.\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\nFeatures explicitly deferred beyond Phase 1 to maintain a lean MVP.\n\n**Phase 2 (Growth Features - Quick Wins Post-Launch):**\n*   Further refined Press Reviews Section (e.g., external link aggregation beyond basic display).\n*   Homepage Hero/Featured Content sections for spotlighting key articles or events.\n*   Enhanced SEO Optimization (advanced meta tags, structured data, sitemap.xml automation refinement).\n*   Performance tuning and optimization based on real user analytics.\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion & Future Vision):**\n*   Advanced search functionalities (filters, facets, autocomplete suggestions).\n*   User authentication (e.g., for personalized content, save/bookmark features).\n*   Interactive elements (e.g., commenting on articles, event registration forms).\n*   Rich media galleries.\n*   Email notifications.\n\n**Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP (No time for this in Phase 1):**\n*   No user authentication.\n*   No user-generated content (e.g., comments, forums).\n*   No complex workflows or approval processes beyond basic content publishing.\n*   No real-time features (chat, live notifications, etc.).\n*   No integrations with external systems (beyond basic content feeds).\n*   No payment processing.\n*   No advanced analytics dashboards built into the platform.\n*   No live chat support.\n*   No event registration with live capacity counts.\n*   No collaborative editing within the CMS.\n*   No full RGAA audit and certification in MVP.\n*   No sign language videos or audio descriptions for complex visual content.\n*   No support for ancient assistive technologies beyond graceful degradation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Mitigated by:\n*   Leveraging proven, stable architectural patterns (Next.js SSR/SSG, Django backend).\n*   Utilizing robust, community-supported frameworks and libraries (Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL, Shadcn UI).\n*   Focusing on core, well-understood capabilities for the MVP.\n*   Adopting modern development practices (CI/CD, automated testing for accessibility, performance monitoring).\n\n**Market Risks:** Addressed by:\n*   Targeting existing, known user pain points (discoverability) with concrete solutions.\n*   Building on existing valuable content, reducing content creation risk.\n*   Prioritizing SEO from day one to ensure market visibility.\n\n**Resource Risks:** Managed by:\n*   A lean \"solo developer\" model, reducing communication and coordination overhead.\n*   Strict adherence to MVP scope and explicit \"out of scope\" definitions to manage workload.\n*   Progressive enhancement ensuring a functional experience even on older browsers/devices.\n\nThis strategic scoping ensures a focused, achievable MVP that delivers significant value and sets a solid foundation for future growth.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n###

The fact should be relatively short and to the point.\n- If you are unsure whether the information is a fact worth remembering long-term. If in doubt, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n\n## Parameters\n\n- `fact` (string, required): The specific fact or piece of information to remember. This should be a clear, self-contained statement. For example, if the user says \"My favorite color is blue\", the fact would be \"My favorite color is blue\".",

This aligns with BMad Master's role as an Executor and Orchestrator.\n2.  **Dev Agent's Role:** The `dev` agent (Amelia) is a Senior Software Engineer. Her explicit function, as defined by her persona, is to execute approved stories by implementing tasks and writing tests. She requires a story file to perform her designated role.\n3.  **Conceptual Ordering:** The statement that \"dev agent comes before dev-story workflow\" refers to the logical hierarchy within the BMad framework: an agent (like a developer) is a defined entity with capabilities, and a workflow (like \"dev-story\") is a process that *utilizes* that agent's capabilities. A developer agent's existence is a prerequisite for a development workflow to be designed around it. It does not imply that the `dev` agent operates in a vacuum without instructions (i.e., a story file).\n\nTherefore, BMad Master created the `codebase`, and the `dev` agent (Amelia) correctly requested a story file as it is her input to begin implementation. There is no contradiction, but rather a distinction in agent roles and workflow dependencies.",

The fact should be relatively short and to the point.\n- If you are unsure whether the information is a fact worth remembering long-term. If in doubt, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n\n## Parameters\n\n- `fact` (string, required): The specific fact or piece of information to remember. This should be a clear, self-contained statement. For example, if the user says \"My favorite color is blue\", the fact would be \"My favorite color is blue\".",

Creates detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.'\nweb_bundle: true\n---\n\n# Create Epics and Stories\n\n**Goal:** Transform PRD requirements and Architecture decisions into comprehensive stories organized by user value, creating detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.\n\n**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are also a product strategist and technical specifications writer collaborating with a product owner. This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring expertise in requirements decomposition, technical implementation context, and acceptance criteria writing, while the user brings their product vision, user needs, and business requirements. Work together as equals.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded, read, and executed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, load, read entire file, then execute the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nLoad, read the full file and then execute `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/steps/step-01-validate-prerequisites.md` to begin the workflow.\n"

Welcome and Overview\n\nWelcome {user_name} to comprehensive epic and story creation!\n\n**CRITICAL PREREQUISITE VALIDATION:**\n\nVerify required documents exist and are complete:\n\n1. **PRD.md** - Contains requirements (FRs and NFRs) and product scope\n2. **Architecture.md** - Contains technical decisions, API contracts, data models\n3. **UX Design.md** (if UI exists) - Contains interaction patterns, mockups, user flows\n\n### 2. Document Discovery and Validation\n\nSearch for required documents using these patterns (sharded means a large document was split into multiple small files with an index.md into a folder) - if the whole document is found, use that instead of the sharded version:\n\n**PRD Document Search Priority:**\n\n1. `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\n**Architecture Document Search Priority:**\n\n1. `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\n**UX Design Document Search (Optional):**\n\n1. `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md` (whole document)\n2. `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/index.md` (sharded version)\n\nBefore proceeding, Ask the user if there are any other documents to include for analysis, and if anything found should be excluded. Wait for user confirmation. Once confirmed, create the {outputFile} from the {epicsTemplate} and in the front matter list the files in the array of `inputDocuments: []`.\n\n### 3. Extract Functional Requirements (FRs)\n\nFrom the PRD document (full or sharded), read then entire document and extract ALL functional requirements:\n\n**Extraction Method:**\n\n- Look for numbered items like \"FR1:\", \"Functional Requirement 1:\", or similar\n- Identify requirement statements that describe what the system must DO\n- Include user actions, system behaviors, and business rules\n\n**Format the FR list as:**\n\n```\nFR1: [Clear, testable requirement description]\nFR2: [Clear, testable requirement description]\n...\n```\n\n### 4. Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n\nFrom the PRD document, extract ALL non-functional requirements:\n\n**Extraction Method:**\n\n- Look for performance, security, usability, reliability requirements\n- Identify constraints and quality attributes\n- Include technical standards and compliance requirements\n\n**Format the NFR list as:**\n\n```\nNFR1: [Performance/Security/Usability requirement]\nNFR2: [Performance/Security/Usability requirement]\n...\n```\n\n### 5. Extract Additional Requirements from Architecture\n\nReview the Architecture document for technical requirements that impact epic and story creation:\n\n**Look for:**\n\n- **Starter Template**: Does Architecture specify a starter/greenfield template? If YES, document this for Epic 1 Story 1\n- Infrastructure and deployment requirements\n- Integration requirements with external systems\n- Data migration or setup requirements\n- Monitoring and logging requirements\n- API versioning or compatibility requirements\n- Security implementation requirements\n\n**IMPORTANT**: If a starter template is mentioned in Architecture, note it prominently. This will impact Epic 1 Story 1.\n\n**Format Additional Requirements as:**\n\n```\n- [Technical requirement from Architecture that affects implementation]\n- [Infrastructure setup requirement]\n- [Integration requirement]\n...\n```\n\n### 6. Extract Additional Requirements from UX (if exists)\n\nReview the UX document for requirements that affect epic and story creation:\n\n**Look for:**\n\n- Responsive design requirements\n- Accessibility requirements\n- Browser/device compatibility\n- User interaction patterns that need implementation\n- Animation or transition requirements\n- Error handling UX requirements\n\n**Add these to Additional Requirements list.**\n\n### 7. Load and Initialize Template\n\nLoad {epicsTemplate} and initialize {outputFile}:\n\n1. Copy the entire template to {outputFile}\n2. Replace {{project_name}} with the actual project name\n3. Replace placeholder sections with extracted requirements:\n   - {{fr_list}} → extracted FRs\n   - {{nfr_list}} → extracted NFRs\n   - {{additional_requirements}} → extracted additional requirements\n4. Leave {{requirements_coverage_map}} and {{epics_list}} as placeholders for now\n\n### 8. Present Extracted Requirements\n\nDisplay to user:\n\n**Functional Requirements Extracted:**\n\n- Show count of FRs found\n- Display the first few FRs as examples\n- Ask if any FRs are missing or incorrectly captured\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements Extracted:**\n\n- Show count of NFRs found\n- Display key NFRs\n- Ask if any constraints were missed\n\n**Additional Requirements:**\n\n- Summarize technical requirements from Architecture\n- Summarize UX requirements (if applicable)\n- Verify completeness\n\n### 9. Get User Confirmation\n\nAsk: \"Do these extracted requirements accurately represent what needs to be built? Any additions or corrections?\"\n\nUpdate the requirements based on user feedback until confirmation is received.\n\n## CONTENT TO SAVE TO DOCUMENT:\n\nAfter extraction and confirmation, update {outputFile} with:\n\n- Complete FR list in {{fr_list}} section\n- Complete NFR list in {{nfr_list}} section\n- All additional requirements in {{additional_requirements}} section\n\n### 10. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: `**Confirm the Requirements are complete and correct to [C] continue:**`\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu option\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Save all to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#10-present-menu-options)\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and all requirements are saved to document and frontmatter is updated, will you then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile} to execute and begin epic design step.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All required documents found and validated\n- All FRs extracted and formatted correctly\n- All NFRs extracted and formatted correctly\n- Additional requirements from Architecture/UX identified\n- Template initialized with requirements\n- User confirms requirements are complete and accurate\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Missing required documents\n- Incomplete requirements extraction\n- Template not properly initialized\n- Not saving requirements to output file\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"

To avoid starting from scratch and potentially introducing \"AI slop\" or less-than-optimal architectural patterns, a decision was made to leverage an existing, high-quality reference project as a blueprint for the initial project setup. This reference project utilizes a similar technology stack (Docker, Django, Next.js) to the planned `laicité-2.0` implementation.\n\n## Decision\n\nThe `laicité-2.0` project will adopt the architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure observed in the provided reference project. This includes its approach to containerization with Docker Compose, configuration management using environment variables and `django-environ`, the structure of its Django backend, and its modern Next.js/React frontend setup.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe reference project provides an exemplary architectural foundation for a modern web application, embodying experienced, human-led architectural decisions. Its key strengths, making it an ideal starting point for `laicité-2.0`, are:\n\n1.  **Containerization & Orchestration:** The use of `docker-compose` facilitates a portable, single-command development environment, cleanly separating `db`, `backend`, and `frontend` services. This promotes consistency across development environments and simplifies deployment.\n2.  **Configuration Management:** The project demonstrates a best-practice approach by using `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` to inject environment-specific variables from a well-organized `.envs` directory. The Django backend then safely consumes these variables via `django-environ`, ensuring a clean separation of code and configuration and enhancing security.\n3.  **Robust Backend:** The Django backend is modular and well-structured, built for scalability and features. It includes pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and provides stubs for advanced components like full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n4.  **Modern Frontend:** The frontend stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript) is state-of-the-art. It utilizes TanStack React Query for sophisticated server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a productive UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui` principles. This ensures a modern, performant, and maintainable user interface.\n\nThis combination of industry-standard tools and proven patterns ensures `laicité-2.0` begins with a professional, scalable, and well-documented structure, significantly reducing initial setup time and architectural risks.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive\n\n*   **Accelerated Development:** A solid architectural foundation allows the team to focus on feature implementation rather than foundational setup.\n*   **Best Practices Adherence:** The project benefits from battle-tested patterns for containerization, configuration, and technology choices.\n*   **Improved Maintainability:** A well-defined and structured project is easier to understand, debug, and extend.\n*   **Scalability Potential:** The chosen technologies and patterns support future scaling of the application.\n*   **Reduced Risk:** Minimized architectural \"unknowns\" and common pitfalls.\n\n### Negative\n\n*   **Learning Curve:** Team members unfamiliar with specific tools or patterns used in the reference project (e.g., `django-environ`, TanStack React Query, `shadcn-ui`) may require an initial learning period.\n*   **Minor Adjustments:** While largely adopted, some specific configurations or features from the reference project may need minor adjustments to perfectly align with `laicité-2.0`'s unique requirements.\n*   **Hardcoded Password:** A minor flaw (hardcoded password in `settings.py` in the reference) must be addressed immediately during initialization to maintain security best practices.\n--- End of content ---"

An opposing council member cites an interpretation of a regional regulation that Madame Lambert believes is incorrect or outdated. She needs to quickly verify the official wording of the regulation to present a counter-argument and ensure an informed decision is made.\n**Goal:** Rapidly find and confirm the exact wording of a specific regional laïcité regulation or official guidance during a live, high-pressure situation.\n**Obstacle:** Time constraints, need for absolute accuracy and authority, inability to easily access official documents on the fly from mobile devices.\n\n**Opening Scene:** The municipal council meeting is tense. Madame Lambert listens as an opposing colleague, confident in their misinterpretation of a laïcité regulation, pushes for a decision she knows is flawed. Her heart rate quickens. She knows the official stance, but needs to present the exact wording, and quickly, before the debate spirals. Fumbling with her tablet, she recalls past frustrations trying to navigate obscure government portals.\n\n**Rising Action:** Remembering the Observatoire's new site, she quickly types \"observatoire laïcité BFC\" into her tablet's browser. The site loads almost instantly, even on the public Wi-Fi. The responsive design adapts perfectly to her tablet screen. She immediately navigates to the \"Documents\" section and uses the \"Regional Guidance\" filter, then refines her search by \"Dole\" (though she knows the regulation is regional, she wants to ensure no local amendments). She quickly types keywords from the regulation into the search bar. The results prioritize official documents, and the correct regulation appears at the top. She opens the PDF, which renders clearly on her tablet, and scrolls directly to the relevant section.\n\n**Climax:** With the official text displayed prominently on her tablet, Madame Lambert confidently interjects. \"With all due respect, my colleague, the official regional guidance on this matter, found on the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC website, states...\" She reads the precise wording, refuting the misinterpretation with undeniable authority. The room quiets, and the debate shifts towards an informed discussion. Her confidence, backed by credible, real-time access to information, changes the direction of the meeting.\n\n**Resolution:** The immediate crisis is averted, and a more accurate decision is made. Madame Lambert feels immense relief and pride. The laicité-2.0 platform has not only saved the day but has solidified her reputation as a meticulous and well-informed councilor. She realizes the site will be an essential tool for all her future work, transforming how she accesses and utilizes official information.\n\n---\n\n### Journey 4: Monsieur Jean-Luc Dubois - Empowered Content Publishing\n\n**User Type:** Association Staff (Content Publisher/Editor)\n**Persona:** Monsieur Jean-Luc Dubois, a dedicated volunteer for the Observatoire.\n**Situation:** Monsieur Dubois is tasked with publishing a new article about an upcoming laïcité awareness campaign in Besançon. In the past, this meant wrestling with the cumbersome and unintuitive WordPress backend, fighting with formatting, and spending hours ensuring correct categorization and tagging. He often hesitated to publish new content due to the sheer effort involved, leading to delays and missed opportunities for timely information dissemination.\n**Goal:** Efficiently publish a new article, including text, images, and proper categorization by city and topic, with minimal friction and confidence that it will be discoverable by the target audience.\n**Obstacle:** Complicated, non-intuitive content management system (CMS), time-consuming formatting, fear of making mistakes, and lack of clarity on how to ensure discoverability.\n\n**Opening Scene:** Monsieur Dubois sits down at his computer, a freshly written article open on one screen and the old WordPress admin login page on the other. He stares at the WordPress page with a familiar sense of dread, recalling past battles with unresponsive editors, lost changes, and baffling menus. He needs this important campaign article to go live today, but the thought of the publishing process drains his energy.\n\n**Rising Action:** Having heard about the new laicité-2.0 platform, he accesses the new, streamlined content management interface (which he can access via a secure link from the public site, or a dedicated admin URL). The interface is clean, modern, and intuitive, a stark contrast to the old system. He finds a prominent \"Create New Article\" button. The editor is a simple, visual Markdown-based interface, making formatting effortless. He easily uploads campaign images, which are automatically optimized. He quickly assigns the article to the \"Campaigns\" category, tags it with \"Besançon\" and \"Awareness,\" and even sees a preview of how it will look on the public site, both desktop and mobile. He sees clear fields for metadata that directly feed into search and filtering.\n\n**Climax:** With a few clicks, Monsieur Dubois reviews the article and clicks \"Publish.\" The system processes it swiftly, and he immediately receives a confirmation message and a direct link to the live article. He then navigates to the public site, filters by \"Besançon,\" and sees his new article proudly displayed, perfectly formatted and discoverable. The entire process took him under 15 minutes—a task that would have consumed over an hour (and his patience) on the old system.\n\n**Resolution:** Monsieur Dubois feels a surge of satisfaction and renewed motivation. The new CMS has completely transformed his role; he's no longer a \"WordPress wrestler\" but an efficient content publisher. He now actively looks for opportunities to create and upload new content, knowing the process is seamless and his efforts will genuinely reach the intended audience. He shares his positive experience with other volunteers, creating a positive feedback loop for content creation.\n\n---\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\nThese narrative journeys reveal the following critical capabilities required for laicité-2.0:\n\n*   **Public-Facing Interface (Frontend):**\n    *   Clean, modern, professional, and responsive design (desktop & mobile).\n    *   Intuitive main navigation.\n    *   Prominent and effective search bar with keyword matching and result prioritization.\n    *   Robust regional/city filtering for all content types (articles, events).\n    *   Clear, well-categorized display of articles, events, and documents with relevant metadata.\n    *   Direct and reliable document download functionality.\n    *   Calendar integration for events.\n    *   Content presentation in clear, accessible language, avoiding jargon where possible.\n    *   Ability to preview content on various devices.\n    *   Credibility and authority signals through design and content.\n\n*   **Content Management System (Backend/Admin Interface):**\n    *   Intuitive, clean, and modern backend interface for content creation and management.\n    *   User-friendly editor (e.g., Markdown-based).\n    *   Simple image upload and automatic optimization.\n    *   Clear categorization and tagging mechanisms (city, topic, campaign).\n    *   Live preview functionality (desktop and mobile).\n    *   Metadata management fields for discoverability (SEO).\n    *   Efficient content publishing workflow with swift processing and confirmation.\n    *   Secure, role-based access control.\n\n*   **Underlying Technical Capabilities:**\n    *   Fast loading times and optimized performance.\n    *   Reliable document storage and retrieval.\n    *   Robust search indexing (PostgreSQL FTS).\n    *   Modular and extensible architecture (Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL with Docker) to support future growth (e.g., authentication, advanced search).\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nLaicité-2.0 will be implemented as a modern web application, leveraging a **hybrid SPA/MPA approach** using Next.js App Router.

The project is focused on \"liberating existing valuable content\" through modern UX, intuitive organization, and effective search.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\nThe application will primarily use:\n*   **Static Generation (SSG):** For stable content such as the homepage, \"About\" page, and core document sections, built at deploy time and served efficiently from a CDN. This optimizes load times and reduces server load for unchanging content.\n*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** For dynamic content including articles and events. Django will serve data to Next.js, which will render full HTML on the server. This ensures excellent SEO, fresh content delivery, and fast initial page loads.\n*   **Client-Side Interactivity:** Targeted use of client-side JavaScript for dynamic elements like search autocompletion, filter dropdowns, and smooth UI transitions (e.g., with Framer Motion). The application will implement **progressive enhancement**, ensuring core content access even without JavaScript.\n\n### Browser Support\n\nThe platform will target modern browser support, specifically the **last 2 major versions** of the following evergreen browsers:\n*   Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)\n*   Firefox\n*   Safari (iOS and macOS)\n*   Mobile browsers: iOS Safari and Chrome on Android (applying the same version policy).\n\nExplicitly **not supported** are Internet Explorer, highly obscure browsers, and browsers older than approximately two years. Testing will focus on primary development in Chrome, regular checks in Firefox/Safari, and periodic checks in Edge, supplemented by tools like BrowserStack.\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nThe application will be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless and optimal experience across all devices: mobile, tablet, and desktop. Design and development will prioritize a mobile-first approach.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\nFast loading times are a critical success factor, directly impacting user satisfaction and SEO. Performance will be optimized through:\n*   Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation.\n*   Optimized image delivery and lazy loading for media assets.\n*   Efficient backend query optimization.\n*   Adherence to Core Web Vitals to ensure rapid loading, interactivity, and visual stability.\n\n### SEO Strategy\n\nSEO is a fundamental requirement, directly addressing the core problem of content discoverability. Our strategy includes:\n*   **Full Crawlability:** SSR/SSG ensures search engines receive fully rendered HTML pages for all content.\n*   **Schema.org Markup:** Implementing structured data for `Article`, `Event`, and `Organization` schemas to enable rich results in search.\n*   **Clean URLs:** Designing user-friendly and SEO-optimized URL structures.\n*   **Automated XML Sitemap:** Ensuring all public content is discoverable by search engines.\n*   **Redirects:** Implementing proper 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs to preserve any existing domain authority.\n*   **Local SEO:** Creating city-specific landing pages or filtered views to capture regional search queries.\n*   **Content Optimization:** Semantic HTML, appropriate meta tags (title, description, Open Graph), and fast image loading.\n*   **Goal:** To dominate the laïcité information niche within the BFC region within 6 months post-launch, relying on credible, organic authority.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\nCompliance with **WCAG 2.1 AA** is the baseline, aligning with French RGAA standards for public service platforms. Accessibility is non-negotiable and will be integrated from the start.\n\n**Key Accessibility Commitments:**\n*   **Semantic HTML:** Strict adherence to proper heading hierarchy, semantic tags (`nav`, `main`, `article`), associated form labels, and correct button elements.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators and logical tab order. Implementation of skip links and modal focus trapping.\n*   **Screen Reader Support:** Comprehensive alt text for all images, appropriate ARIA labels, `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates (search results, filters), and proper landmark roles.\n*   **Color and Contrast:** Adherence to WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large), not relying on color alone for information conveyance.\n*   **Responsive & Flexible Design:** Text scaling up to 200% without breakage, no horizontal scrolling at 320px width, and appropriate touch target sizes.\n*   **Accessible Forms:** Clear labels, descriptive error messages, and accessible validation feedback.\n\n**Tools & Practices:**\n*   Leveraging Shadcn UI (built on Radix UI) for inherently accessible components.\n*   Automated testing with tools like axe DevTools, Lighthouse, and Pa11y in CI/CD.\n*   Manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).\n*   Consideration for `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations.\n*   An **Accessibility Statement** will be published on the site, detailing our commitment, known issues, and feedback channels.\n\n**Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP Accessibility:** Full RGAA audit/certification, sign language videos, audio descriptions for complex visual content, and support for ancient assistive technologies.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** This project embraces a **Problem-Solving MVP** philosophy.

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nThe 41 identified Functional Requirements (FRs) comprehensively cover the core capabilities for `laicité-2.0`. These FRs primarily focus on content presentation and discovery (articles, events, documents, press reviews, search, filtering), as well as a dedicated Content Management System (CMS) for staff. All identified FRs are considered essential for the MVP, forming the \"capability contract\" for downstream work.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\nThe following NFRs are critical architectural drivers:\n\n*   **Performance:** Requires fast loading times (core pages < 2s, search results < 1s) and optimized image delivery, necessitating efficient data retrieval, caching strategies, and optimized asset handling.\n*   **Security:** Demands robust authentication (MFA for staff), comprehensive data encryption (at rest and in transit), and fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) for CMS functionalities.\n*   **Scalability:** The architecture must accommodate a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over 24 months without significant performance degradation, implying horizontal scaling capabilities and stateless component design.\n*   **Accessibility:** Strict adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards is a non-negotiable requirement, influencing UI component selection, semantic structuring, and testing practices.\n*   **Reliability:** The system requires 99.9% uptime and robust data backup/restore mechanisms to ensure continuous availability.\n*   **Maintainability:** As a solo-developer project, the codebase must be clean, modular, well-documented, and easy to deploy and update to minimize operational overhead and prevent project failure due to complexity.\n*   **Integration:** The system needs to support basic calendar integration for events.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\n\n-   Primary domain: Full-stack Web Application\n-   Complexity level: **Medium (simple scope, high implementation quality bar)**. The project scope, centered around a content platform with CRUD operations and core discovery features, remains relatively simple. However, the demanding NFRs (performance, security, accessibility, scalability, and maintainability) elevate the implementation complexity, requiring robust architectural decisions and adherence to high quality standards.\n-   Estimated architectural components: (To be elaborated in subsequent architectural decision steps)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n*   **Core Technology Stack:** The architecture is constrained by the chosen stack: Next.js (frontend/SSR/SSG), Django (backend/API), and PostgreSQL (database), all orchestrated via Docker. This dictates the technology choices for components and deployment.\n*   **Deployment Environment:** Docker containerization implies a focus on container orchestration for deployment and management.\n*   **Solo Developer Model:** Architectural decisions must prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance to support efficient development and operational management by a single developer.\n*   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** The architecture must establish a flexible foundation that can seamlessly integrate user authentication in the future without requiring a major re-architecture. The choice of Django REST Framework and modular Next.js supports this.\n*   **Image Optimization Strategy:** While Next.js provides excellent image components, the backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage, considering options like local file storage versus cloud object storage (e.g., S3/Scaleway) for scalability and reliability.\n*   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** A critical technical requirement is to implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs to preserve SEO and ensure a smooth user transition. This will require a mapping and redirection mechanism within the application or at the proxy layer.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n*   **Security:** Encompasses authentication, authorization, and data protection across the entire system.\n*   **Performance:** Impacts user experience and SEO across all public-facing components.\n*   **Accessibility:** Must be integrated from the ground up into all UI and content presentation layers.\n*   **SEO:** Directly tied to content discoverability and requires careful architectural consideration for SSR/SSG, sitemaps, and metadata management.\n*   **Content Management:** The core mechanism for the Observatoire staff to maintain and update the platform's value.\n*   **Maintainability:** Essential for long-term project viability, especially with a solo development model.\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nFull-stack Web Application (Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker) based on project requirements analysis.\n\n### Frontend Starter Selection\n\n*   **Selected Starter:** `create-next-app` (official Next.js CLI)\n*   **Rationale:** Provides the most up-to-date and minimal foundation for Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript. This allows for precise integration of preferred frontend libraries (Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod, Shadcn UI, Framer Motion) without unnecessary boilerplate.\n\n**Initialization Command (Frontend - to be executed in `/frontend` directory):**\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest . --typescript\n```\n\n**Key Architectural Decisions from Frontend Starter:**\n\n*   **Language & Runtime:** TypeScript for Next.js.\n*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router.\n*   **Styling Solution:** Initial setup allows for integration of Vanilla CSS with BEM methodology using Shadcn UI.\n*   **Build Tooling:** Next.js integrated build system.\n*   **Code Organization:** Standard Next.js App Router project structure.\n\n### Backend Setup Approach\n\n*   **Selected Approach:** Manual Django project initialization with `django-admin startproject`.\n*   **Rationale:** Provides maximum control over project structure and dependencies, allows for precise integration of required libraries (Django REST Framework, django-allauth, dj-rest-auth), and avoids unwanted boilerplate from external starter templates. This approach leverages proven patterns from a reference project while maintaining adherence to the specific architectural decisions made for `laicité-2.0`.\n\n**Initialization Steps (Backend - to be executed in `/backend` directory):**\n\n```bash\ncd backend/\ndjango-admin startproject laicite_config .\n# Followed by manual configuration of dependencies, settings, Docker, and project structure\n# leveraging patterns from a private reference repository.\n```\n\n**Key Architectural Decisions from Backend Setup:**\n\n*   **Language & Runtime:** Python for Django 5.x.\n*   **Framework:** Django with Django REST Framework.\n   **Database:** PostgreSQL integration.\n*   **Authentication:** Token-based authentication using `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` (with MFA support for staff).\n*   **API Documentation:** Automated API documentation (to be integrated manually).\n*   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose setup (to be configured manually).\n\n### Full-Stack Docker Compose Integration Strategy\n\nThis section outlines how to integrate the independently generated Next.js frontend and Django backend into a cohesive development and deployment environment using Docker Compose, adhering to your monorepo and VPS deployment preferences.\n\n**Monorepo Structure (Target):**\n\n```\n/project-root\n├── frontend/  (Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript)\n├── backend/   (Django 5.x + DRF)\n└── docker-compose.dev.yml\n└── docker-compose.prod.yml\n└── nginx/ (for production reverse proxy)\n```\n\n**Development (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) Goals:**\n\n*   **Frontend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Next.js development server.\n    *   `ports`: Expose Next.js dev server (e.g., `3000:3000`).\n    *   `volumes`: Mount local frontend code for hot reload.\n    *   `environment`: Point Next.js to the backend API (`http://backend:8000` within Docker network).\n*   **Backend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Django development server.\n    *   `ports`: Expose Django dev server (e.g., `8000:8000`).\n    *   `volumes`: Mount local backend code for hot reload.\n    *   `environment`: Configure Django to use the PostgreSQL service.\n*   **Database Service:**\n    *   `image`: PostgreSQL 16+ Docker image.\n    *   `volumes`: Persistent volume for data.\n    *   `environment`: Database credentials.\n*   **Hot Reloading:** Leverage Docker volumes and framework-specific HMR/auto-reloading for instant reflection of code changes.\n*   **API Communication:** Frontend communicates with backend service via internal Docker network name (`http://backend:8000`).\n\n**Production (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) Goals:**\n\n*   **Frontend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Next.js production build (`next build`).\n    *   `command`: Start Next.js production server (`next start`).\n*   **Backend Service:**\n    *   `build`: Django production build (e.g., collectstatic).\n    *   `command`: Start Gunicorn/Uvicorn for Django.\n*   **Database Service:** Same as development, but with robust backup strategy.\n*   **Nginx Service:**\n    *   `build`: Custom Nginx configuration (from `nginx/nginx.conf`).\n    *   `ports`: Expose `80:80`, `443:443`.\n    *   `volumes`: Mount static files, media files, and `nginx.conf`.\n    *   `depends_on`: Frontend and Backend services.\n    *   **Role:** Act as reverse proxy, serve static assets, handle SSL termination.\n*   **Volume Management:** Persistent volumes for PostgreSQL data, Django media files.\n\n**Development Workflow Features (to be integrated):**\n\n*   **ESLint + Prettier:** To be integrated into both frontend (`package.json` scripts) and backend (`pyproject.toml` for Python linting).\n*   **Git Hooks (Pre-commit):** A `pre-commit` framework (like `husky` for JS or `pre-commit` for Python) will be configured to run linting and type checks automatically.\n*   **Basic CI/CD Skeleton:** A GitHub Actions (or similar) workflow will be outlined for automated testing and deployment to the VPS.\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n*   **Authentication System:** Using `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for robust and future-proof token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n*   **Authorization Pattern:** Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):\n*   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach - application-level caching (TanStack Query, Next.js, Django view/lru_cache) initially, with a migration path to Redis if needed.\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n*   None explicitly deferred in these categories yet.\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n*   **Decision:** Hybrid Caching Strategy\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Initial Approach (MVP):**\n        *   **Frontend Caching:** TanStack Query for client-side data fetching and caching; Next.js built-in caching (ISR, SSG) and Image Optimization.\n        *   **Backend Caching:** Django's view-level caching using decorators for frequently accessed endpoints; Database query optimization (indexing, `select_related`, `prefetch_related`); `functools.lru_cache` for expensive computations.\n    *   **Rationale:** Prioritizes simplicity, aligns with solo-developer model, leverages existing tech stack, measures performance before adding complexity.\n    *   **Future Migration Path:** If profiling reveals bottlenecks, introduce Redis for API response caching, session storage, full-page caching, and rate limiting.\n*   **Affects:** Frontend performance, Backend performance, Database load.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n*   **Decision:** Authentication System (Update)\n*   **Details:** Replaced `django-rest-knox` with `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth`.\n    *   **Rationale:** More robust, battle-tested, comprehensive MFA support, better documentation, handles email verification/password reset, future-proof for general user authentication, better integration with DRF.\n*   **Affects:** Backend authentication implementation, overall security posture.\n\n*   **Decision:** Authorization Pattern for CMS\n*   **Details:** Django's built-in permissions and groups, with custom permissions defined in model Meta classes as needed.\n    *   **Rationale:** Meets MVP RBAC needs for CMS staff (Editor, Admin, Contributor roles), leverages existing Django features, simple and maintainable for solo developer, avoids unnecessary complexity of object_level permissions for MVP.\n*   **Affects:** Backend authorization, CMS functionalities, staff access control.\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\nMultiple areas where AI agents could make different choices if not explicitly defined, including naming conventions across database, API, and code, various structural patterns, data format conventions, and communication/process patterns.\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming Conventions:**\n*   **Table names:** `plural_snake_case` (e.g., `articles`, `press_reviews`, `event_categories`)\n*   **Column names:** `singular_snake_case` (e.g., `created_at`, `author_name`, `is_published`)\n*   **Primary keys:** `id` (Django default)\n*   **Foreign keys:** `{model_name}_id` (e.g., `author_id`, `category_id`)\n*   **Junction tables:** `{model1}_{model2}` (e.g., `articles_tags`)\n*   **Rationale:** Aligns with Django ORM and Python ecosystem, adheres to PostgreSQL best practices, allows for clean frontend-backend casing transformation at API serialization layer.\n\n**API Naming Conventions:**\n*   **URL Paths (Endpoints):** `kebab-case` (e.g., `/api/press-reviews/`, `/api/event-categories/`, `/api/search-results/`)\n*   **Query Parameters:** `snake_case` (e.g., `/api/articles?category_id=5&is_published=true`)\n*   **JSON Request/Response Bodies:** `snake_case` (e.g., `{ \"article_id\": 123, \"title\": \"Example\" }`)\n*   **HTTP Headers:** `Kebab-Case` (e.g., `Content-Type`, `X-API-Version`)\n*   **Frontend Transformation:** Frontend will handle `snake_case` to `camelCase` transformation in the data-fetching layer (e.g., using TanStack Query's `select` option or utility functions).\n*   **Rationale:** Web standard URLs, consistency with backend/database, simpler backend implementation, frontend flexibility, clear separation of concerns.\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n*   **Backend (Python/Django) - PEP 8 Conventions:**\n    *   Files: `snake_case` (e.g., `article_serializers.py`, `event_views.py`)\n    *   Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ArticleSerializer`, `EventViewSet`)\n    *   Functions/methods: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_published_articles()`, `calculate_reading_time()`)\n    *   Variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `article_count`, `is_published`, `created_at`)\n    *   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`)\n*   **Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js/React) - JavaScript/TypeScript Conventions:**\n    *   Files: `kebab-case` for pages/components (e.g., `article-card.tsx`, `event-list.tsx`, `use-articles.ts`)\n    *   React Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ArticleCard`, `EventList`)\n    *   Functions/hooks: `camelCase` (e.g., `formatDate()`, `useArticles()`)\n    *   Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `articleCount`, `isPublished`, `createdAt`)\n    *   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` or `camelCase` (both common)\n    *   Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ArticleCardProps`, `EventCategory`)\n    *   CSS Classes: BEM with `kebab-case` (e.g., `.article-card`, `.article-card__title`)\n*   **Rationale:** Leverages existing ecosystem knowledge, improves readability and maintainability within each codebase.\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n*   **Monorepo Structure:** `/project-root` containing `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `nginx/`. (Reconfirmed from Starter Template Evaluation)\n*   **Frontend:** Standard Next.js App Router project structure.\n*   **Backend:** Standard Django project structure with apps like `cms/`, `content/`, `search/`.\n*   **Tests:** Co-located with code where appropriate, or in a dedicated `tests/` directory within each app/module.\n*   **Shared Utilities/Types:** Centralized in a designated `lib/` or `types/` folder in the frontend, and shared utility modules in the backend.\n\n**File Structure Patterns:**\n*   Configuration files: Standard locations (`.env`, `next.config.ts`, `settings.py`).\n*   Static assets: `public/` in frontend, `static/` in backend apps.\n*   Documentation: `docs/` or within relevant sections.\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API Data Transformation Strategy:**\n*   **Decision:** Backend Serializer Transformation.\n*   **Details:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and `camelCase` to `snake_case` for API requests.\n*   **Rationale:** Creates a clear `camelCase` API contract, simplifies frontend, improves type safety, enhances reusability for other API consumers, easier API contract testing. Implementation via a base serializer class with conversion methods.\n\n**API Response Formats:**\n*   **Decision:** Hybrid API Response Format Strategy.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Simple Endpoints (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH for single resources):** Direct data return.\n    *   **Collection/List Endpoints (with pagination, filtering, metadata):** Standardized wrapper `{ \"data\": [...], \"meta\": { pagination: ... } }`.\n    *   **Search/Complex Queries:** Wrapper `{ \"data\": { ... }, \"meta\": { query: ..., totalResults: ... } }`.\n    *   **Error Responses:** Always wrapped `{ \"error\": { code: ..., message: ..., details: ... } }`.\n    *   **DELETE Operations:** `204 No Content` or `{ \"success\": true }`.\n*   **Rationale:** Pragmatic, avoids unnecessary complexity, aligns with DRF defaults, extensible, frontend-friendly, clear decision rules.\n\n**Standardized Error Response Structure:**\n*   **Decision:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n*   **Details:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"error\": {\n        \"code\": \"VALIDATION_ERROR\",\n        \"message\": \"Invalid input data\",\n        \"details\": { /* optional: granular info, e.g., field errors */ },\n        \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-08T10:30:45Z\", /* optional but recommended */\n        \"path\": \"/api/articles\" /* optional but recommended */\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    *   **Environment-Specific:** `exception` and `stackTrace` included in `details` only during development.\n*   **Rationale:** Provides machine-readable codes for frontend logic, human-readable messages for users/debugging, granular details for validation, and aids debugging with timestamps/paths. Production readiness, developer experience.\n*   **Implementation:** Custom DRF exception handler on the backend. Frontend handles with TanStack Query's `onError` and conditional logic.\n\n### Communication Patterns\n\n**Inter-Service Communication (Backend):**\n*   **Decision:** Follow a \"You Aren't Gonna Need It\" (YAGNI) principle for backend inter-service communication.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Initial Approach (MVP):** Direct function calls between Django apps, direct ORM access, and Django signals for decoupled event handling (e.g., `post_save` for notifications).\n    *   **When to Add Celery/Redis:** Only when specific scenarios (bulk emails, long-running data processing, external API calls, scheduled tasks) necessitate it.\n    *   **Future Migration Path:** Add Redis to `docker-compose.yml`, install Celery/`django-celery-beat`, convert slow operations to Celery tasks.\n*   **Rationale:** Zero infrastructure overhead for MVP, simple debugging, fast development, sufficient for MVP, avoids over-engineering, supports solo-developer model.\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling:** (Covered by Standardized Error Response Structure)\n**Loading States:** (Will be covered during Frontend implementation, likely via TanStack Query's `isLoading`/`isFetching` and local `useState` for UI components).\n**Authentication Flow:** (Handled by `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` on backend, integrated on frontend with TanStack Query for API calls).\n**Validation:** (Zod + React Hook Form on frontend, Django Forms/Serializers on backend).\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n*   Adhere to defined naming conventions for database, API, and code.\n*   Utilize the specified project and file structures.\n*   Follow the API data transformation and response format strategies.\n*   Implement error handling according to the standardized error response structure.\n*   Employ the agreed-upon inter-service communication patterns.\n*   Utilize TanStack Query for server state and Zustand for client UI state in the frontend.\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n*   Automated linting and type checking via CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for code naming and structure.\n*   Code reviews to ensure adherence to API, database, and architectural patterns.\n*   API documentation (generated by DRF) to serve as a single source of truth for API contracts.\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**Hosting Strategy:**\n*   **Decision:** Initial deployment to a 20GB Virtual Private Server (VPS).\n*   **Resource Allocation (Initial):** 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM, 20GB SSD, 500GB bandwidth/month.\n*   **Rationale:** Cost-effective, sufficient for 5+ years at current growth rate, avoids over-provisioning, aligns with solo-developer model.\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline Approach:**\n*   **Decision:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n*   **Stages & Tools:**\n    *   **Lint:** Frontend (ESLint + Prettier), Backend (Black + Flake8 + isort).\n    *   **Type Check:** Frontend (TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`), Backend (mypy - optional).\n    *   **Test:** Frontend (Jest + React Testing Library), Backend (pytest with coverage against PostgreSQL container).\n    *   **Build:** Build Docker images for frontend/backend, push to GitHub Container Registry.\n    *   **Deploy:** SSH into VPS, pull latest images, `docker-compose up -d`, run migrations/collectstatic, health check (only on `main` branch).\n*   **Branch Strategy:** `main` for auto-deploy, `develop` for tests only, feature branches for lint/test only, PRs for full pipeline.\n*   **Rationale:** Balances automation and simplicity, integrated with GitHub, cost-effective (free tier), catches bugs early, ensures consistent and reliable deployments, provides an audit trail.\n\n## Project Structure & Boundaries\n\n### Complete Project Directory Structure\n```\n/project-root\n├── .gemini/\n├── _bmad/\n├── _bmad-output/\n├── client_expression.md\n├── docker-compose.dev.yml\n├── docker-compose.prod.yml\n├── Makefile\n├── nginx/\n│   └── nginx.conf\n├── frontend/\n│   ├── .env\n│   ├── .env.example\n│   ├── package.json\n│   ├── package-lock.json\n│   ├── next.config.ts\n│   ├── tsconfig.json\n│   ├── biome.json\n│   ├── public/\n│   │   └── assets/ (images, icons)\n│   ├── src/\n│   │   ├── app/ (Next.js App Router)\n│   │   │   ├── (auth)/ (route group for auth-related pages)\n│   │   │   ├── (main)/ (route group for main application pages)\n│   │   │   ├── globals.css\n│   │   │   ├── layout.tsx\n│   │   │   └── page.tsx\n│   │   ├── components/\n│   │   │   ├── ui/ (Shadcn UI components)\n│   │   │   ├── features/ (e.g., articles/ArticleCard, events/EventList)\n│   │   │   └── auth/ (LoginForm, SignupForm)\n│   │   ├── lib/\n│   │   │   ├── api/ (TanStack Query client setup, API functions)\n│   │   │   ├── hooks/ (Custom React hooks)\n│   │   │   ├── utils/ (Utility functions)\n│   │   │   └── types/ (TypeScript type definitions and interfaces)\n│   │   ├── store/ (Zustand stores for client UI state)\n│   │   └── middleware.ts (Next.js middleware)\n│   └── tests/ (Jest, React Testing Library)\n├── backend/\n│   ├── .env\n│   ├── .env.example\n│   ├── manage.py\n│   ├── requirements.txt\n│   ├── Dockerfile\n│   ├── conda_environment.yaml\n│   ├── laicite_config/ (project settings, URLs, WSGI/ASGI)\n│   ├── cms/ (Django app for CMS functionalities)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── content/ (Django app for articles, events, documents)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── search/ (Django app for search)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── users/ (Django app for custom user model, allauth integration)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── notifications/ (Django app for notifications)\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   └── core/ (shared backend utilities, custom exception handler, base serializers)\n```\n\n### Architectural Boundaries\n\n**API Boundaries:**\n*   **External API Endpoints:** Defined by DRF routes in `backend/laicite_config/urls.py` and individual app `urls.py` (e.g., `backend/content/urls.py`). All endpoints exposed under `/api/` (e.g., `/api/articles/`, `/api/press-reviews/`).\n*   **Authentication/Authorization Boundaries:** Handled by `backend/users/` app, integrated via DRF views and Django permissions system. Next.js middleware (`frontend/src/middleware.ts`) and API client (`frontend/src/lib/api/`) will manage token handling and authentication status on the client.\n*   **Data Access Layer Boundaries:** Django ORM provides the primary boundary between business logic and database. Direct ORM access is restricted to model managers and services within their respective Django apps.\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n*   **Frontend Component Communication:** Primarily props drilling for parent-child, Context API for global theme/locale, Zustand for client UI state, and TanStack Query for server state.\n*   **Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls and ORM access between Django apps for synchronous operations. Django signals for event-driven, decoupled communication.\n*   **Event-Driven Integration Points:** Django signals (backend) and potential custom event bus (frontend) for loose coupling between components/features.\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n*   **Database Schema:** Managed by Django models within each app (e.g., `backend/content/models.py`), enforced by migrations. PostgreSQL is the central data store.\n*   **Caching Boundaries:** TanStack Query cache on the frontend for server data. Django's view-level and `lru_cache` for backend performance, with clear boundaries on what data is cached and for how long.\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**Feature/Epic Mapping:**\n*   **Content Presentation (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews):**\n    *   Backend: `backend/content/` (models, views, serializers, admin), `backend/cms/` (admin customizations).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(main)/articles/`, `events/`, `documents/`, `press-reviews/` (pages), `frontend/src/components/features/` (e.g., `ArticleCard`, `EventList`), `frontend/src/lib/api/` (API calls for content).\n*   **Search and Filtering:**\n    *   Backend: `backend/search/` (views, serializers, search logic).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(main)/search/` (page), `frontend/src/components/features/search/` (search bar, filter components), `frontend/src/lib/api/` (API calls for search).\n*   **CMS Functionalities (for Staff):**\n    *   Backend: `backend/cms/` (admin, custom views, specific models), `backend/users/` (RBAC implementation).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/`, `frontend/src/app/(main)/admin/` (protected admin pages), `frontend/src/components/features/cms/`.\n*   **User Authentication (Future):**\n    *   Backend: `backend/users/` (allauth integration, custom user model).\n    *   Frontend: `frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/`, `signup/`, `reset-password/`, `frontend/src/components/auth/`.\n\n**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**\n*   **Security (Auth/Authz):** `backend/users/`, `frontend/src/middleware.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/api/`.\n*   **Performance (Caching):** `frontend/src/lib/api/` (TanStack Query), backend (Django view caching, `functools.lru_cache`).\n*   **Accessibility:** Frontend components in `frontend/src/components/ui/` and `features/`, enforced via linting.\n*   **SEO:** Next.js metadata API in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` and page-level layouts.\n*   **Maintainability:** Enforced by code naming conventions, CI/CD linting/formatting, clear project structure.\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n*   **Frontend:** TanStack Query for server state updates, Zustand for client UI state, React Context for themes.\n*   **Backend:** Direct function calls and ORM access between Django apps. Django signals for event-driven decoupling.\n*   **API:** All communication between frontend and backend via the REST API, using `camelCase` JSON bodies and `kebab-case` URLs.\n\n**External Integrations:**\n*   **Calendar Integration:** Dedicated service/module within `backend/content/` or `backend/integrations/` to interact with external calendar APIs. Frontend components in `frontend/src/components/features/events/`.\n*   **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image Component handles frontend optimization. Backend media storage via Django's file storage (local or cloud like S3/Scaleway if introduced).\n\n**Data Flow:**\n*   Frontend (React Components) -> (TanStack Query / React Hook Form / Zustand) -> (API client in `frontend/src/lib/api/`) -> Backend (DRF Views) -> (DRF Serializers) -> (Django Models/ORM) -> PostgreSQL.\n*   Data flows back in reverse, with DRF serializers transforming `snake_case` database data to `camelCase` API responses.\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n*   **Frontend:** `.env`, `.env.example`, `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `biome.json`.\n*   **Backend:** `.env`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`, `manage.py`, `backend/laicite_config/settings.py`.\n*   **Shared:** `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `nginx/nginx.conf`.\n\n**Source Organization:**\n*   **Frontend:** `src/` as the main source directory, further organized by App Router conventions (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `store/`, `types/`).\n*   **Backend:** Main project (`laicite_config/`) and individual Django apps (`cms/`, `content/`, etc.) each with their `models.py`, `views.py`, `serializers.py`, `admin.py`. Shared utilities in `backend/core/`.\n\n**Test Organization:**\n*   **Frontend:** `tests/` directory at the root of `frontend/` (or co-located with components for smaller tests).\n*   **Backend:** `tests/` directory within each Django app.\n*   **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` for automated testing.\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n*   **Frontend:** `frontend/public/assets/` for static images, fonts, and other public assets.\n*   **Backend:** Media files handled by Django's `MEDIA_ROOT` (local filesystem initially, cloud storage like S3/Scaleway if introduced).\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n*   `docker-compose.dev.yml` orchestrates frontend (Next.js dev server), backend (Django dev server), and PostgreSQL database. Mounted volumes for hot-reloading.\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n*   `Dockerfile` in `frontend/` and `backend/` define container images.\n*   GitHub Actions `build` stage handles `docker build` and `docker push` to GitHub Container Registry.\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n*   `docker-compose.prod.yml` defines the production deployment on the VPS, including Nginx as a reverse proxy.\n*   GitHub Actions `deploy` stage handles SSH into VPS, pulling images, running `docker-compose up -d`, migrations, and static file collection.\n"

To avoid starting from scratch and potentially introducing \"AI slop\" or less-than-optimal architectural patterns, a decision was made to leverage an existing, high-quality reference project as a blueprint for the initial project setup. This reference project utilizes a similar technology stack (Docker, Django, Next.js) to the planned `laicité-2.0` implementation.\n\n## Decision\n\nThe `laicité-2.0` project will adopt the architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure observed in the provided reference project. This includes its approach to containerization with Docker Compose, configuration management using environment variables and `django-environ`, the structure of its Django backend, and its modern Next.js/React frontend setup.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe reference project provides an exemplary architectural foundation for a modern web application, embodying experienced, human-led architectural decisions. Its key strengths, making it an ideal starting point for `laicité-2.0`, are:\n\n1.  **Containerization & Orchestration:** The use of `docker-compose` facilitates a portable, single-command development environment, cleanly separating `db`, `backend`, and `frontend` services. This promotes consistency across development environments and simplifies deployment.\n2.  **Configuration Management:** The project demonstrates a best-practice approach by using `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` to inject environment-specific variables from a well-organized `.envs` directory. The Django backend then safely consumes these variables via `django-environ`, ensuring a clean separation of code and configuration and enhancing security.\n3.  **Robust Backend:** The Django backend is modular and well-structured, built for scalability and features. It includes pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and provides stubs for advanced components like full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n4.  **Modern Frontend:** The frontend stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript) is state-of-the-art. It utilizes TanStack React Query for sophisticated server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a productive UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui` principles. This ensures a modern, performant, and maintainable user interface.\n\nThis combination of industry-standard tools and proven patterns ensures `laicité-2.0` begins with a professional, scalable, and well-documented structure, significantly reducing initial setup time and architectural risks.\n\n## Consequences\n\n### Positive\n\n*   **Accelerated Development:** A solid architectural foundation allows the team to focus on feature implementation rather than foundational setup.\n*   **Best Practices Adherence:** The project benefits from battle-tested patterns for containerization, configuration, and technology choices.\n*   **Improved Maintainability:** A well-defined and structured project is easier to understand, debug, and extend.\n*   **Scalability Potential:** The chosen technologies and patterns support future scaling of the application.\n*   **Reduced Risk:** Minimized architectural \"unknowns\" and common pitfalls.\n\n### Negative\n\n*   **Learning Curve:** Team members unfamiliar with specific tools or patterns used in the reference project (e.g., `django-environ`, TanStack React Query, `shadcn-ui`) may require an initial learning period.\n*   **Minor Adjustments:** While largely adopted, some specific configurations or features from the reference project may need minor adjustments to perfectly align with `laicité-2.0`'s unique requirements.\n*   **Hardcoded Password:** A minor flaw (hardcoded password in `settings.py` in the reference) must be addressed immediately during initialization to maintain security best practices.\n"

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool.

Review Extracted Requirements\n\nLoad {outputFile} and review:\n\n- **Functional Requirements:** Count and review FRs from Step 1\n- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Review NFRs that need to be addressed\n- **Additional Requirements:** Review technical and UX requirements\n\n### 2. Explain Epic Design Principles\n\n**EPIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**\n\n1. **User-Value First**: Each epic must enable users to accomplish something meaningful\n2. **Requirements Grouping**: Group related FRs that deliver cohesive user outcomes\n3. **Incremental Delivery**: Each epic should deliver value independently\n4. **Logical Flow**: Natural progression from user's perspective\n5. **🔗 Dependency-Free Within Epic**: Stories within an epic must NOT depend on future stories\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:**\nOrganize by USER VALUE, not technical layers:\n\n**✅ CORRECT Epic Examples (Standalone & Enable Future Epics):**\n\n- Epic 1: User Authentication & Profiles (users can register, login, manage profiles) - **Standalone: Complete auth system**\n- Epic 2: Content Creation (users can create, edit, publish content) - **Standalone: Uses auth, creates content**\n- Epic 3: Social Interaction (users can follow, comment, like content) - **Standalone: Uses auth + content**\n- Epic 4: Search & Discovery (users can find content and other users) - **Standalone: Uses all previous**\n\n**❌ WRONG Epic Examples (Technical Layers or Dependencies):**\n\n- Epic 1: Database Setup (creates all tables upfront) - **No user value**\n- Epic 2: API Development (builds all endpoints) - **No user value**\n- Epic 3: Frontend Components (creates reusable components) - **No user value**\n- Epic 4: Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD setup) - **No user value**\n\n**🔗 DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n\n- Each epic must deliver COMPLETE functionality for its domain\n- Epic 2 must not require Epic 3 to function\n- Epic 3 can build upon Epic 1 & 2 but must stand alone\n\n### 3. Design Epic Structure Collaboratively\n\n**Step A: Identify User Value Themes**\n\n- Look for natural groupings in the FRs\n- Identify user journeys or workflows\n- Consider user types and their goals\n\n**Step B: Propose Epic Structure**\nFor each proposed epic:\n\n1. **Epic Title**: User-centric, value-focused\n2. **User Outcome**: What users can accomplish after this epic\n3. **FR Coverage**: Which FR numbers this epic addresses\n4. **Implementation Notes**: Any technical or UX considerations\n\n**Step C: Create the epics_list**\n\nFormat the epics_list as:\n\n```\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: [Epic Title]\n[Epic goal statement - what users can accomplish]\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.\n\n### Epic 2: [Epic Title]\n[Epic goal statement - what users can accomplish]\n**FRs covered:** FR4, FR5, FR6, etc.\n\n[Continue for all epics]\n```\n\n### 4. Present Epic List for Review\n\nDisplay the complete epics_list to user with:\n\n- Total number of epics\n- FR coverage per epic\n- User value delivered by each epic\n- Any natural dependencies\n\n### 5. Create Requirements Coverage Map\n\nCreate {{requirements_coverage_map}} showing how each FR maps to an epic:\n\n```\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - [Brief description]\nFR2: Epic 1 - [Brief description]\nFR3: Epic 2 - [Brief description]\n...\n```\n\nThis ensures no FRs are missed.\n\n### 6. Collaborative Refinement\n\nAsk user:\n\n- \"Does this epic structure align with your product vision?\"\n- \"Are all user outcomes properly captured?\"\n- \"Should we adjust any epic groupings?\"\n- \"Are there natural dependencies we've missed?\"\n\n### 7. Get Final Approval\n\n**CRITICAL:** Must get explicit user approval:\n\"Do you approve this epic structure for proceeding to story creation?\"\n\nIf user wants changes:\n\n- Make the requested adjustments\n- Update the epics_list\n- Re-present for approval\n- Repeat until approval is received\n\n## CONTENT TO UPDATE IN DOCUMENT:\n\nAfter approval, update {outputFile}:\n\n1. Replace {{epics_list}} placeholder with the approved epic list\n2. Replace {{requirements_coverage_map}} with the coverage map\n3. Ensure all FRs are mapped to epics\n\n### 8. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: \"**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}\n- IF C: Save approved epics_list to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#8-present-menu-options)\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution completes, redisplay the menu\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond when conversation ends, redisplay the menu options\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and the approved epics_list is saved to document, will you then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile} to execute and begin story creation step.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Epics designed around user value\n- All FRs mapped to specific epics\n- epics_list created and formatted correctly\n- Requirements coverage map completed\n- User gives explicit approval for epic structure\n- Document updated with approved epics\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Epics organized by technical layers\n- Missing FRs in coverage map\n- No user approval obtained\n- epics_list not saved to document\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"

to add events to popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n-   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n{{requirements_coverage_map}}\n\n## Epic List\n\n{{epics_list}}\n\n<!-- Repeat for each epic in epics_list (N = 1, 2, 3...) -->\n\n## Epic {{N}}: {{epic_title_N}}\n\n{{epic_goal_N}}\n\n<!-- Repeat for each story (M = 1, 2, 3...) within epic N -->\n\n### Story {{N}}.{{M}}: {{story_title_N_M}}\n\nAs a {{user_type}},\nI want {{capability}},\nSo that {{value_benefit}}.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n<!-- for each AC on this story -->\n\n**Given** {{precondition}}\n**When** {{action}}\n**Then** {{expected_outcome}}\n**And** {{additional_criteria}}\n\n<!-- End story repeat -->\n"

Load Approved Epic Structure\n\nLoad {outputFile} and review:\n\n- Approved epics_list from Step 2\n- FR coverage map\n- All requirements (FRs, NFRs, additional)\n- Template structure at the end of the document\n\n### 2. Explain Story Creation Approach\n\n**STORY CREATION GUIDELINES:**\n\nFor each epic, create stories that:\n\n- Follow the exact template structure\n- Are sized for single dev agent completion\n- Have clear user value\n- Include specific acceptance criteria\n- Reference requirements being fulfilled\n\n**🚨 DATABASE/ENTITY CREATION PRINCIPLE:**\nCreate tables/entities ONLY when needed by the story:\n\n- ❌ WRONG: Epic 1 Story 1 creates all 50 database tables\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each story creates/alters ONLY the tables it needs\n\n**🔗 STORY DEPENDENCY PRINCIPLE:**\nStories must be independently completable in sequence:\n\n- ❌ WRONG: Story 1.2 requires Story 1.3 to be completed first\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each story can be completed based only on previous stories\n- ❌ WRONG: \"Wait for Story 1.4 to be implemented before this works\"\n- ✅ RIGHT: \"This story works independently and enables future stories\"\n\n**STORY FORMAT (from template):**\n\n```\n### Story {N}.{M}: {story_title}\n\nAs a {user_type},\nI want {capability},\nSo that {value_benefit}.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** {precondition}\n**When** {action}\n**Then** {expected_outcome}\n**And** {additional_criteria}\n```\n\n**✅ GOOD STORY EXAMPLES:**\n\n_Epic 1: User Authentication_\n\n- Story 1.1: User Registration with Email\n- Story 1.2: User Login with Password\n- Story 1.3: Password Reset via Email\n\n_Epic 2: Content Creation_\n\n- Story 2.1: Create New Blog Post\n- Story 2.2: Edit Existing Blog Post\n- Story 2.3: Publish Blog Post\n\n**❌ BAD STORY EXAMPLES:**\n\n- Story: \"Set up database\" (no user value)\n- Story: \"Create all models\" (too large, no user value)\n- Story: \"Build authentication system\" (too large)\n- Story: \"Login UI (depends on Story 1.3 API endpoint)\" (future dependency!)\n- Story: \"Edit post (requires Story 1.4 to be implemented first)\" (wrong order!)\n\n### 3. Process Epics Sequentially\n\nFor each epic in the approved epics_list:\n\n#### A. Epic Overview\n\nDisplay:\n\n- Epic number and title\n- Epic goal statement\n- FRs covered by this epic\n- Any NFRs or additional requirements relevant\n\n#### B. Story Breakdown\n\nWork with user to break down the epic into stories:\n\n- Identify distinct user capabilities\n- Ensure logical flow within the epic\n- Size stories appropriately\n\n#### C. Generate Each Story\n\nFor each story in the epic:\n\n1. **Story Title**: Clear, action-oriented\n2. **User Story**: Complete the As a/I want/So that format\n3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Write specific, testable criteria\n\n**AC Writing Guidelines:**\n\n- Use Given/When/Then format\n- Each AC should be independently testable\n- Include edge cases and error conditions\n- Reference specific requirements when applicable\n\n#### D. Collaborative Review\n\nAfter writing each story:\n\n- Present the story to user\n- Ask: \"Does this story capture the requirement correctly?\"\n- \"Is the scope appropriate for a single dev session?\"\n- \"Are the acceptance criteria complete and testable?\"\n\n#### E. Append to Document\n\nWhen story is approved:\n\n- Append it to {outputFile} following template structure\n- Use correct numbering (Epic N, Story M)\n- Maintain proper markdown formatting\n\n### 4. Epic Completion\n\nAfter all stories for an epic are complete:\n\n- Display epic summary\n- Show count of stories created\n- Verify all FRs for the epic are covered\n- Get user confirmation to proceed to next epic\n\n### 5. Repeat for All Epics\n\nContinue the process for each epic in the approved list, processing them in order (Epic 1, Epic 2, etc.).\n\n### 6. Final Document Completion\n\nAfter all epics and stories are generated:\n\n- Verify the document follows template structure exactly\n- Ensure all placeholders are replaced\n- Confirm all FRs are covered\n- Check formatting consistency\n\n## TEMPLATE STRUCTURE COMPLIANCE:\n\nThe final {outputFile} must follow this structure exactly:\n\n1. **Overview** section with project name\n2. **Requirements Inventory** with all three subsections populated\n3. **FR Coverage Map** showing requirement to epic mapping\n4. **Epic List** with approved epic structure\n5. **Epic sections** for each epic (N = 1, 2, 3...)\n   - Epic title and goal\n   - All stories for that epic (M = 1, 2, 3...)\n     - Story title and user story\n     - Acceptance Criteria using Given/When/Then format\n\n### 7. Present FINAL MENU OPTIONS\n\nAfter all epics and stories are complete:\n\nDisplay: \"**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}\n- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}\n- IF C: Save content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then only then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#7-present-final-menu-options)\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu options\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [all epics and stories saved to document following the template structure exactly], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin final validation phase.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All epics processed in sequence\n- Stories created for each epic\n- Template structure followed exactly\n- All FRs covered by stories\n- Stories appropriately sized\n- Acceptance criteria are specific and testable\n- Document is complete and ready for development\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Deviating from template structure\n- Missing epics or stories\n- Stories too large or unclear\n- Missing acceptance criteria\n- Not following proper formatting\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"

organization.\nFR38: The system generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: The system handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: The system provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: The system generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Core public-facing pages (homepage, article list, event list, document list) shall load within **2 seconds** on a standard broadband connection.\nNFR2: Search results shall be displayed within **1 second** from query submission.\nNFR3: All images shall be optimized to ensure minimal load time impact.\nNFR4: Staff access to the Content Management Interface shall require multi-factor authentication.\nNFR5: All data, both at rest and in transit, shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\nNFR6: The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure staff can only access authorized CMS functionalities.\nNFR7: The platform shall support a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over the next 24 months without significant performance degradation (>10%).\nNFR8: The architecture shall be designed to allow for horizontal scaling of web servers and database instances.\nNFR9: The platform shall be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\nNFR10: All interactive elements shall be fully navigable and operable via keyboard.\nNFR11: All

to add events to popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n-   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms article publication\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides direct link to published article\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates XML sitemap\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content\n\n## Epic List\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Epic 2: Staff Content Management & Access\nAuthorized staff can efficiently create, edit, publish, and manage all content types (Articles, Events, Documents) through a user-friendly CMS, with secure access.\n**FRs covered:** FR16, FR17, FR18, FR20, FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25, FR26, FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30, FR31, FR32, FR33, FR34, FR35, FR36, FR40.\n\n### Epic 3: Enhanced Public User Experience\nPublic users can interact with content through downloads and calendar integration, experiencing a professional, accessible, and performant platform.\n**FRs covered:** FR15, FR19, FR37, FR38, FR41.\n\n<!-- Repeat for each epic in epics_list (N = 1, 2, 3...) -->\n\n## Epic {{N}}: {{epic_title_N}}\n\n{{epic_goal_N}}\n\n<!-- Repeat for each story (M = 1, 2, 3...) within epic N -->\n\n### Story {{N}}.{{M}}: {{story_title_N_M}}\n\nAs a {{user_type}},\nI want {{capability}},\nSo that {{value_benefit}}.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n<!-- for each AC on this story -->\n\n**Given** {{precondition}}\n**When** {{action}}\n**Then** {{expected_outcome}}\n**And** {{additional_criteria}}\n\n<!-- End story repeat -->\n"

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed.

NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals.

load within **2 seconds** on a standard broadband connection.\nNFR2: Search results shall be displayed within **1 second** from query submission.\nNFR3: All images shall be optimized to ensure minimal load time impact.\nNFR4: Staff access to the Content Management Interface shall require multi-factor authentication.\nNFR5: All data, both at rest and in transit, shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\nNFR6: The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure staff can only access authorized CMS functionalities.\nNFR7: The platform shall support a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over the next 24 months without significant performance degradation (>10%).\nNFR8: The architecture shall be designed to allow for horizontal scaling of web servers and database instances.\nNFR9: The platform shall be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\nNFR10: All interactive elements shall be fully navigable and operable via keyboard.\nNFR11: All

to add events to popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n-   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms article publication\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides direct link to published article\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates XML sitemap\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content\n\n## Epic List\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n### Epic 2: Staff Content Management & Access\nAuthorized staff can efficiently create, edit, publish, and manage all content types (Articles, Events, Documents) through a user-friendly CMS, with secure access.\n**FRs covered:** FR16, FR17, FR18, FR20, FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25, FR26, FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30, FR31, FR32, FR33, FR34, FR35, FR36, FR40.\n\n### Epic 3: Enhanced Public User Experience\nPublic users can interact with content through downloads and calendar integration, experiencing a professional, accessible, and performant platform.\n**FRs covered:** FR15, FR19, FR37, FR38, FR41.\n\n<!-- Repeat for each epic in epics_list (N = 1, 2, 3...) -->\n\n## Epic {{N}}: {{epic_title_N}}\n\n{{epic_goal_N}}\n\n<!-- Repeat for each story (M = 1, 2, 3...) within epic N -->\n\n### Story {{N}}.{{M}}: {{story_title_N_M}}\n\nAs a {{user_type}},\nI want {{capability}},\nSo that {{value_benefit}}.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n<!-- for each AC on this story -->\n\n**Given** {{precondition}}\n**When** {{action}}\n**Then** {{expected_outcome}}\n**And** {{additional_criteria}}\n\n<!-- End story repeat -->\n"

to add events to popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n-   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms article publication\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides direct link to published article\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates XML sitemap\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content\n\n## Epic List\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n### Epic 2: Staff Content Management & Access\nAuthorized staff can efficiently create, edit, publish, and manage all content types (Articles, Events, Documents) through a user-friendly CMS, with secure access.\n**FRs covered:** FR16, FR17, FR18, FR20, FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25, FR26, FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30, FR31, FR32, FR33, FR34, FR35, FR36, FR40.\n\n### Epic 3: Enhanced Public User Experience\nPublic users can interact with content through downloads and calendar integration, experiencing a professional, accessible, and performant platform.\n**FRs covered:** FR15, FR19, FR37, FR38, FR41.\n\n<!-- Repeat for each epic in epics_list (N = 1, 2, 3...) -->\n\n## Epic {{N}}: {{epic_title_N}}\n\n{{epic_goal_N}}\n\n<!-- Repeat for each story (M = 1, 2, 3...) within epic N -->\n\n### Story {{N}}.{{M}}: {{story_title_N_M}}\n\nAs a {{user_type}},\nI want {{capability}},\nSo that {{value_benefit}}.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n<!-- for each AC on this story -->\n\n**Given** {{precondition}}\n**When** {{action}}\n**Then** {{expected_outcome}}\n**And** {{additional_criteria}}\n\n<!-- End story repeat -->\n"

can preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Authorized staff can publish articles.\nFR34: The system confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: The system provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: The system provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: The system generates Schema.org markup for articles, events, and organization.\nFR38: The system generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: The system handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: The system provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: The system generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Core public-facing pages (homepage, article list, event list, document list) shall load within **2 seconds** on a standard broadband connection.\nNFR2: Search results shall be displayed within **1 second** from query submission.\nNFR3: All images shall be optimized to ensure minimal load time impact.\nNFR4: Staff access to the Content Management Interface shall require multi-factor authentication.\nNFR5: All data, both at rest and in transit, shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\nNFR6: The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure staff can only access authorized CMS functionalities.\nNFR7: The platform shall support a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over the next 24 months without significant performance degradation (>10%).\nNFR8: The architecture shall be designed to allow for horizontal scaling of web servers and database instances.\nNFR9: The platform shall be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\nNFR10: All interactive elements shall be fully navigable and operable via keyboard.\nNFR11: All non-text content (e.g., images) shall have appropriate alternative text for screen readers.\nNFR12: The platform shall provide clear visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation.\nNFR13: The system shall maintain an uptime of 99.9% (excluding scheduled maintenance).\nNFR14: Data backups shall be performed daily and restorable within 24 hours.\nNFR15: The system shall provide an option for users to add events to popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n-   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms article publication\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides direct link to published article\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates XML sitemap\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n### Epic 2: Staff Content Management & Access\nAuthorized staff can efficiently create, edit, publish, and manage all content types (Articles, Events, Documents) through a user-friendly CMS, with secure access.\n**FRs covered:** FR16, FR17, FR18, FR20, FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25, FR26, FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30, FR31, FR32, FR33, FR34, FR35, FR36, FR40.\n\n### Epic 3: Enhanced Public User Experience\nPublic users can interact with content through downloads and calendar integration, experiencing a professional, accessible, and performant platform.\n**FRs covered:** FR15, FR19, FR37, FR38, FR41.\n\n\n"

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

Architecture Implementation Validation\n\n**Check for Starter Template Setup:**\n\n- Does Architecture document specify a starter template?\n- If YES: Epic 1 Story 1 must be \"Set up initial project from starter template\"\n- This includes cloning, installing dependencies, initial configuration\n\n**Database/Entity Creation Validation:**\n\n- Are database tables/entities created ONLY when needed by stories?\n- ❌ WRONG: Epic 1 creates all tables upfront\n- ✅ RIGHT: Tables created as part of the first story that needs them\n- Each story should create/modify ONLY what it needs\n\n### 3. Story Quality Validation\n\n**Each story must:**\n\n- Be completable by a single dev agent\n- Have clear acceptance criteria\n- Reference specific FRs it implements\n- Include necessary technical details\n- **Not have forward dependencies** (can only depend on PREVIOUS stories)\n- Be implementable without waiting for future stories\n\n### 4. Epic Structure Validation\n\n**Check that:**\n\n- Epics deliver user value, not technical milestones\n- Dependencies flow naturally\n- Foundation stories only setup what's needed\n- No big upfront technical work\n\n### 5. Dependency Validation (CRITICAL)\n\n**Epic Independence Check:**\n\n- Does each epic deliver COMPLETE functionality for its domain?\n- Can Epic 2 function without Epic 3 being implemented?\n- Can Epic 3 function standalone using Epic 1 & 2 outputs?\n- ❌ WRONG: Epic 2 requires Epic 3 features to work\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each epic is independently valuable\n\n**Within-Epic Story Dependency Check:**\nFor each epic, review stories in order:\n\n- Can Story N.1 be completed without Stories N.2, N.3, etc.?\n- Can Story N.2 be completed using only Story N.1 output?\n- Can Story N.3 be completed using only Stories N.1 & N.2 outputs?\n- ❌ WRONG: \"This story depends on a future story\"\n- ❌ WRONG: Story references features not yet implemented\n- ✅ RIGHT: Each story builds only on previous stories\n\n### 6. Complete and Save\n\nIf all validations pass:\n\n- Update any remaining placeholders in the document\n- Ensure proper formatting\n- Save the final epics.md\n\n**Present Final Menu:**\n**All validations complete!** [C] Complete Workflow\n\nWhen C is selected, the workflow is complete and the epics.md is ready for development.\n"

The fact should be relatively short and to the point.\n- If you are unsure whether the information is a fact worth remembering long-term. If in doubt, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n\n## Parameters\n\n- `fact` (string, required): The specific fact or piece of information to remember. This should be a clear, self-contained statement. For example, if the user says \"My favorite color is blue\", the fact would be \"My favorite color is blue\".",

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

(This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

(This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption.

Check for Existing Project Context\n\nFirst, check if project context already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{project_knowledge}/project-context.md or {project-root}/**/project-context.md`\n- If exists: Read complete file to understand existing rules\n- Present to user: \"Found existing project context with {number_of_sections} sections. Would you like to update this or create a new one?\"\n\n### 2. Discover Project Technology Stack\n\nLoad and analyze project files to identify technologies:\n\n**Architecture Document:**\n\n- Look for `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n- Extract technology choices with specific versions\n- Note architectural decisions that affect implementation\n\n**Package Files:**\n\n- Check for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.\n- Extract exact versions of all dependencies\n- Note development vs production dependencies\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n\n- Look for project language specific configs ( example: `tsconfig.json`)\n- Build tool configs (webpack, vite, next.config.js, etc.)\n- Linting and formatting configs (.eslintrc, .prettierrc, etc.)\n- Testing configurations (jest.config.js, vitest.config.ts, etc.)\n\n### 3. Identify Existing Code Patterns\n\nSearch through existing codebase for patterns:\n\n**Naming Conventions:**\n\n- File naming patterns (PascalCase, kebab-case, etc.)\n- Component/function naming conventions\n- Variable naming patterns\n- Test file naming patterns\n\n**Code Organization:**\n\n- How components are structured\n- Where utilities and helpers are placed\n- How services are organized\n- Test organization patterns\n\n**Documentation Patterns:**\n\n- Comment styles and conventions\n- Documentation requirements\n- README and API doc patterns\n\n### 4. Extract Critical Implementation Rules\n\nLook for rules that AI agents might miss:\n\n**Language-Specific Rules:**\n\n- TypeScript strict mode requirements\n- Import/export conventions\n- Async/await vs Promise usage patterns\n- Error handling patterns specific to the language\n\n**Framework-Specific Rules:**\n\n- React hooks usage patterns\n- API route conventions\n- Middleware usage patterns\n- State management patterns\n\n**Testing Rules:**\n\n- Test structure requirements\n- Mock usage conventions\n- Integration vs unit test boundaries\n- Coverage requirements\n\n**Development Workflow Rules:**\n\n- Branch naming conventions\n- Commit message patterns\n- PR review requirements\n- Deployment procedures\n\n### 5. Initialize Project Context Document\n\nBased on discovery, create or update the context document:\n\n#### A. Fresh Document Setup (if no existing context)\n\nCopy template from `{installed_path}/project-context-template.md` to `{output_folder}/project-context.md`\nInitialize frontmatter fields.\n\n#### B. Existing Document Update\n\nLoad existing context and prepare for updates\nSet frontmatter `sections_completed` to track what will be updated\n\n### 6. Present Discovery Summary\n\nReport findings to user:\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've analyzed your project for {{project_name}} to discover the context that AI agents need.\n\n**Technology Stack Discovered:**\n{{list_of_technologies_with_versions}}\n\n**Existing Patterns Found:**\n\n- {{number_of_patterns}} implementation patterns\n- {{number_of_conventions}} coding conventions\n- {{number_of_rules}} critical rules\n\n**Key Areas for Context Rules:**\n\n- {{area_1}} (e.g., TypeScript configuration)\n- {{area_2}} (e.g., Testing patterns)\n- {{area_3}} (e.g., Code organization)\n\n{if_existing_context}\n**Existing Context:** Found {{sections}} sections already defined. We can update or add to these.\n{/if_existing_context}\n\nReady to create/update your project context. This will help AI agents implement code consistently with your project's standards.\n\n[C] Continue to context generation\"\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing project context properly detected and handled\n✅ Technology stack accurately identified with versions\n✅ Critical implementation patterns discovered\n✅ Project context document properly initialized\n✅ Discovery findings clearly presented to user\n✅ User ready to proceed with context generation\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not checking for existing project context before creating new one\n❌ Missing critical technology versions or configurations\n❌ Overlooking important coding patterns or conventions\n❌ Not initializing frontmatter properly\n❌ Not presenting clear discovery summary to user\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, load `./step-02-generate.md` to collaboratively generate the specific project context rules.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until user explicitly selects [C] from the menu and discovery is confirmed and the initial file has been written as directed in this discovery step!\n"

The current website struggles with poor user experience, confusing navigation, and ineffective content dissemination, leading to missed mission impact and low engagement. Our vision is to provide an ideal experience where users can effortlessly find relevant information—articles, events, official documents, and regional initiatives—within seconds, specifically organized by city. This platform will feature a modern, accessible, and visually appealing design that builds trust and enhances engagement across all devices.\n\nThe core of this initiative is to **liberate existing valuable content**—articles, events, and documents—currently trapped within an inefficient delivery system. Our mission is to set this content free through modern UX, intuitive organization, and effective search, making it discoverable, organized, and professional.\n\n### What Makes This Special\n\nLaicité-2.0 stands out through its commitment to:\n\n*   **Regional Authority:** Solidifying the Observatoire's position as the definitive BFC voice with exclusive local content and official documentation.\n*   **City-Level Granularity:** Providing uniquely organized content by city, offering personally relevant information to users.\n*   **Comprehensive Resource Hub:** Consolidating and making discoverable all relevant articles, events, documents, and press reviews in a single, unified, and searchable location.\n*   **Modern, Accessible Experience:** Delivering a professional and intuitive design that matches the importance of the Observatoire's mission.\n*   **Built for Growth:** Leveraging a modular Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL architecture with Docker orchestration for future extensibility, proactively addressing evolving requirements like authentication.\n*   **SEO-Optimized:** Implementing a robust technical foundation to ensure high discoverability through search engines.\n\n### Project Classification\n\n**Technical Type:** web_app\n**Domain:** general\n**Complexity:** low\n**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project (focused on rebuilding and liberating existing content)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\nUser success for laicité-2.0 is defined by the user's ability to efficiently achieve their objectives, develop confidence and trust in the platform, experience serendipitous discovery, and reduce their need for external support.\n\n**1.

The transformation is about making existing value discoverable, organized, and professional.\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### Journey 1: Marie Dubois - Navigating Laïcité in Dijon\n\n**User Type:** General Public/Citizens (First-Time Visitor)\n**Persona:** Marie Dubois, a concerned citizen in Dijon.\n**Situation:** Marie recently heard a news report about laïcité and feels she doesn't fully understand its implications in daily life. She's tried searching online before, but usually gets overwhelmed by national-level political debates or confusing legal jargon. She wants to understand what laïcité means for *her* community.\n**Goal:** Find clear, accessible information about laïcité principles and discover if there are any local initiatives or events in Dijon she could learn more from.\n**Obstacle:** Overwhelm from generic search results, difficulty discerning reliable local information, fear of misinterpreting complex topics.\n\n**Opening Scene:** Marie is at her kitchen table, phone in hand, feeling a familiar frustration after a quick Google search for \"laïcité Dijon\". The results are a mix of news articles, opinion pieces, and official-looking but hard-to-navigate government sites. She sighs, feeling no closer to understanding what's relevant to *her* daily life.\n\n**Rising Action:** A friend casually mentions the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC has a new website. Intrigued by the regional focus, Marie types \"observatoire laïcité BFC\" into her browser. She lands on the laicité-2.0 homepage. The design is clean and modern, immediately conveying professionalism. A prominent search bar catches her eye, but she first notices a \"Regions & Cities\" dropdown in the navigation. She selects \"Dijon.\" The page instantly updates, displaying articles and events specifically for her city. She clicks on an article titled \"Laïcité in Your Daily Life: A Dijon Perspective.\" The language is clear, concise, and avoids jargon, answering many of her initial questions.\n\n**Climax:** While browsing Dijon's content, she sees a small section for \"Upcoming Events in Dijon.\" There's a local panel discussion about laïcité at her community center next week. It's exactly the kind of accessible, local engagement she was looking for. She easily finds the date, time, and location, and even an option to add it to her calendar.\n\n**Resolution:** Marie adds the event to her calendar. She feels a sense of relief and empowerment. She finally has a reliable, local source for information and engagement. She bookmarks the laicité-2.0 site, knowing she'll return often. She even shares the event link with a neighbor who had similar questions, confidently stating, \"This is the place for laïcité in BFC!\"\n\n---\n\n### Journey 2: Mr. Thomas Leclerc - Authoritative Resources for the Classroom\n\n**User Type:** Educators/Teachers (Resource Acquisition Scenario)\n**Persona:** Mr. Thomas Leclerc, a history teacher in Besançon.\n**Situation:** Mr. Leclerc needs to prepare a lesson on the official Charte de la laïcité for his 10th-grade class tomorrow. He vaguely remembers seeing a downloadable version somewhere on the old Observatoire website, but his previous attempts to find it were frustrating and time-consuming, often leading to an outdated copy from a national government site. He needs the most current, official version for his regional context.\n**Goal:** Quickly locate and download the official Charte de la laïcité and possibly find supplementary teaching materials related to it.\n**Obstacle:** Difficulty navigating disorganized content, outdated or non-authoritative resources, time pressure.\n\n**Opening Scene:** It's late evening, and Mr. Leclerc is deep in lesson planning. He opens his laptop, dreading the inevitable hunt for the official Charte de la laïcité. His last attempt involved clicking through multiple broken links and sifting through generic PDFs. He knows how critical it is to have the official, up-to-date document for his students, especially with varying interpretations.\n\n**Rising Action:** Remembering the buzz about the new laicité-2.0 site, he navigates directly there. The clean, academic-friendly layout instantly reassures him. He spots a clear \"Documents\" section in the main navigation. Clicking it, he's presented with well-organized categories like \"Official Charters,\" \"Teaching Resources,\" and \"Legal Frameworks.\" He selects \"Official Charters,\" and there, prominently displayed, is \"La Charte de la Laïcité.\" A single click initiates a clean, direct download of the PDF. He also notices a related section, \"Trophées de la Laïcité,\" which he quickly scans, finding a \"Lesson Plans\" subsection that could provide excellent supplementary material.\n\n**Climax:** Within minutes, Mr. Leclerc has the official Charte downloaded and saved, along with a promising set of lesson plans for engaging classroom discussion. The clarity and authority of the materials instantly boost his confidence for tomorrow's class. He easily filters the \"Teaching Resources\" section by \"Besançon\" and finds local examples to share with his students, making the topic more relatable.\n\n**Resolution:** Relieved, Mr. Leclerc finishes his lesson plan feeling well-prepared and professional. He knows he can confidently present the information to his students, backed by an authoritative regional source. He makes a mental note to share this site with his colleagues at the next department meeting, knowing it will save them similar frustrations. laicité-2.0 has become an indispensable tool in his teaching arsenal.\n\n---\n\n### Journey 3: Madame Sophie Lambert - Authoritative Guidance in Real-Time\n\n**User Type:** Local Officials/Public Administrators (Urgent Reference Scenario)\n**Persona:** Madame Sophie Lambert, a municipal councilor in Dole.\n**Situation:** Madame Lambert is in a heated public meeting discussing a contentious local issue with implications for laïcité. An opposing council member cites an interpretation of a regional regulation that Madame Lambert believes is incorrect or outdated. She needs to quickly verify the official wording of the regulation to present a counter-argument and ensure an informed decision is made.\n**Goal:** Rapidly find and confirm the exact wording of a specific regional laïcité regulation or official guidance during a live, high-pressure situation.\n**Obstacle:** Time constraints, need for absolute accuracy and authority, inability to easily access official documents on the fly from mobile devices.\n\n**Opening Scene:** The municipal council meeting is tense. Madame Lambert listens as an opposing colleague, confident in their misinterpretation of a laïcité regulation, pushes for a decision she knows is flawed. Her heart rate quickens. She knows the official stance, but needs to present the exact wording, and quickly, before the debate spirals. Fumbling with her tablet, she recalls past frustrations trying to navigate obscure government portals.\n\n**Rising Action:** Remembering the Observatoire's new site, she quickly types \"observatoire laïcité BFC\" into her tablet's browser. The site loads almost instantly, even on the public Wi-Fi. The responsive design adapts perfectly to her tablet screen. She immediately navigates to the \"Documents\" section and uses the \"Regional Guidance\" filter, then refines her search by \"Dole\" (though she knows the regulation is regional, she wants to ensure no local amendments). She quickly types keywords from the regulation into the search bar. The results prioritize official documents, and the correct regulation appears at the top. She opens the PDF, which renders clearly on her tablet, and scrolls directly to the relevant section.\n\n**Climax:** With the official text displayed prominently on her tablet, Madame Lambert confidently interjects. \"With all due respect, my colleague, the official regional guidance on this matter, found on the Observatoire de la Laïcité - BFC website, states...\" She reads the precise wording, refuting the misinterpretation with undeniable authority. The room quiets, and the debate shifts towards an informed discussion. Her confidence, backed by credible, real-time access to information, changes the direction of the meeting.\n\n**Resolution:** The immediate crisis is averted, and a more accurate decision is made. Madame Lambert feels immense relief and pride. The laicité-2.0 platform has not only saved the day but has solidified her reputation as a meticulous and well-informed councilor. She realizes the site will be an essential tool for all her future work, transforming how she accesses and utilizes official information.\n\n---\n\n### Journey 4: Monsieur Jean-Luc Dubois - Empowered Content Publishing\n\n**User Type:** Association Staff (Content Publisher/Editor)\n**Persona:** Monsieur Jean-Luc Dubois, a dedicated volunteer for the Observatoire.\n**Situation:** Monsieur Dubois is tasked with publishing a new article about an upcoming laïcité awareness campaign in Besançon. In the past, this meant wrestling with the cumbersome and unintuitive WordPress backend, fighting with formatting, and spending hours ensuring correct categorization and tagging. He often hesitated to publish new content due to the sheer effort involved, leading to delays and missed opportunities for timely information dissemination.\n**Goal:** Efficiently publish a new article, including text, images, and proper categorization by city and topic, with minimal friction and confidence that it will be discoverable by the target audience.\n**Obstacle:** Complicated, non-intuitive content management system (CMS), time-consuming formatting, fear of making mistakes, and lack of clarity on how to ensure discoverability.\n\n**Opening Scene:** Monsieur Dubois sits down at his computer, a freshly written article open on one screen and the old WordPress admin login page on the other. He stares at the WordPress page with a familiar sense of dread, recalling past battles with unresponsive editors, lost changes, and baffling menus. He needs this important campaign article to go live today, but the thought of the publishing process drains his energy.\n\n**Rising Action:** Having heard about the new laicité-2.0 platform, he accesses the new, streamlined content management interface (which he can access via a secure link from the public site, or a dedicated admin URL). The interface is clean, modern, and intuitive, a stark contrast to the old system. He finds a prominent \"Create New Article\" button. The editor is a simple, visual Markdown-based interface, making formatting effortless. He easily uploads campaign images, which are automatically optimized. He quickly assigns the article to the \"Campaigns\" category, tags it with \"Besançon\" and \"Awareness,\" and even sees a preview of how it will look on the public site, both desktop and mobile. He sees clear fields for metadata that directly feed into search and filtering.\n\n**Climax:** With a few clicks, Monsieur Dubois reviews the article and clicks \"Publish.\" The system processes it swiftly, and he immediately receives a confirmation message and a direct link to the live article. He then navigates to the public site, filters by \"Besançon,\" and sees his new article proudly displayed, perfectly formatted and discoverable. The entire process took him under 15 minutes—a task that would have consumed over an hour (and his patience) on the old system.\n\n**Resolution:** Monsieur Dubois feels a surge of satisfaction and renewed motivation. The new CMS has completely transformed his role; he's no longer a \"WordPress wrestler\" but an efficient content publisher. He now actively looks for opportunities to create and upload new content, knowing the process is seamless and his efforts will genuinely reach the intended audience. He shares his positive experience with other volunteers, creating a positive feedback loop for content creation.\n\n---\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\nThese narrative journeys reveal the following critical capabilities required for laicité-2.0:\n\n*   **Public-Facing Interface (Frontend):**\n    *   Clean, modern, professional, and responsive design (desktop & mobile).\n    *   Intuitive main navigation.\n    *   Prominent and effective search bar with keyword matching and result prioritization.\n    *   Robust regional/city filtering for all content types (articles, events).\n    *   Clear, well-categorized display of articles, events, and documents with relevant metadata.\n    *   Direct and reliable document download functionality.\n    *   Calendar integration for events.\n    *   Content presentation in clear, accessible language, avoiding jargon where possible.\n    *   Ability to preview content on various devices.\n    *   Credibility and authority signals through design and content.\n\n*   **Content Management System (Backend/Admin Interface):**\n    *   Intuitive, clean, and modern backend interface for content creation and management.\n    *   User-friendly editor (e.g., Markdown-based).\n    *   Simple image upload and automatic optimization.\n    *   Clear categorization and tagging mechanisms (city, topic, campaign).\n    *   Live preview functionality (desktop and mobile).\n    *   Metadata management fields for discoverability (SEO).\n    *   Efficient content publishing workflow with swift processing and confirmation.\n    *   Secure, role-based access control.\n\n*   **Underlying Technical Capabilities:**\n    *   Fast loading times and optimized performance.\n    *   Reliable document storage and retrieval.\n    *   Robust search indexing (PostgreSQL FTS).\n    *   Modular and extensible architecture (Next.js/Django/PostgreSQL with Docker) to support future growth (e.g., authentication, advanced search).\n\n## Web App Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\nLaicité-2.0 will be implemented as a modern web application, leveraging a **hybrid SPA/MPA approach** using Next.js App Router. This strategy ensures optimal performance and SEO while providing a dynamic user experience for interactive elements. The project is focused on \"liberating existing valuable content\" through modern UX, intuitive organization, and effective search.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\nThe application will primarily use:\n*   **Static Generation (SSG):** For stable content such as the homepage, \"About\" page, and core document sections, built at deploy time and served efficiently from a CDN. This optimizes load times and reduces server load for unchanging content.\n*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** For dynamic content including articles and events. Django will serve data to Next.js, which will render full HTML on the server. This ensures excellent SEO, fresh content delivery, and fast initial page loads.\n*   **Client-Side Interactivity:** Targeted use of client-side JavaScript for dynamic elements like search autocompletion, filter dropdowns, and smooth UI transitions (e.g., with Framer Motion). The application will implement **progressive enhancement**, ensuring core content access even without JavaScript.\n\n### Browser Support\n\nThe platform will target modern browser support, specifically the **last 2 major versions** of the following evergreen browsers:\n*   Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)\n*   Firefox\n*   Safari (iOS and macOS)\n*   Mobile browsers: iOS Safari and Chrome on Android (applying the same version policy).\n\nExplicitly **not supported** are Internet Explorer, highly obscure browsers, and browsers older than approximately two years. Testing will focus on primary development in Chrome, regular checks in Firefox/Safari, and periodic checks in Edge, supplemented by tools like BrowserStack.\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nThe application will be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless and optimal experience across all devices: mobile, tablet, and desktop. Design and development will prioritize a mobile-first approach.\n\n### Performance Targets\n\nFast loading times are a critical success factor, directly impacting user satisfaction and SEO. Performance will be optimized through:\n*   Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation.\n*   Optimized image delivery and lazy loading for media assets.\n*   Efficient backend query optimization.\n*   Adherence to Core Web Vitals to ensure rapid loading, interactivity, and visual stability.\n\n### SEO Strategy\n\nSEO is a fundamental requirement, directly addressing the core problem of content discoverability. Our strategy includes:\n*   **Full Crawlability:** SSR/SSG ensures search engines receive fully rendered HTML pages for all content.\n*   **Schema.org Markup:** Implementing structured data for `Article`, `Event`, and `Organization` schemas to enable rich results in search.\n*   **Clean URLs:** Designing user-friendly and SEO-optimized URL structures.\n*   **Automated XML Sitemap:** Ensuring all public content is discoverable by search engines.\n*   **Redirects:** Implementing proper 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs to preserve any existing domain authority.\n*   **Local SEO:** Creating city-specific landing pages or filtered views to capture regional search queries.\n*   **Content Optimization:** Semantic HTML, appropriate meta tags (title, description, Open Graph), and fast image loading.\n*   **Goal:** To dominate the laïcité information niche within the BFC region within 6 months post-launch, relying on credible, organic authority.\n\n### Accessibility Level\n\nCompliance with **WCAG 2.1 AA** is the baseline, aligning with French RGAA standards for public service platforms. Accessibility is non-negotiable and will be integrated from the start.\n\n**Key Accessibility Commitments:**\n*   **Semantic HTML:** Strict adherence to proper heading hierarchy, semantic tags (`nav`, `main`, `article`), associated form labels, and correct button elements.\n*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard with visible focus indicators and logical tab order. Implementation of skip links and modal focus trapping.\n*   **Screen Reader Support:** Comprehensive alt text for all images, appropriate ARIA labels, `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates (search results, filters), and proper landmark roles.\n*   **Color and Contrast:** Adherence to WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large), not relying on color alone for information conveyance.\n*   **Responsive & Flexible Design:** Text scaling up to 200% without breakage, no horizontal scrolling at 320px width, and appropriate touch target sizes.\n*   **Accessible Forms:** Clear labels, descriptive error messages, and accessible validation feedback.\n\n**Tools & Practices:**\n*   Leveraging Shadcn UI (built on Radix UI) for inherently accessible components.\n*   Automated testing with tools like axe DevTools, Lighthouse, and Pa11y in CI/CD.\n*   Manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).\n*   Consideration for `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations.\n*   An **Accessibility Statement** will be published on the site, detailing our commitment, known issues, and feedback channels.\n\n**Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP Accessibility:** Full RGAA audit/certification, sign language videos, audio descriptions for complex visual content, and support for ancient assistive technologies.\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** This project embraces a **Problem-Solving MVP** philosophy. The core goal is to liberate existing valuable content from its current ineffective delivery system and present it in a discoverable, organized, and professional manner. The MVP will solve the primary user pain points related to information access and user experience with a focused, minimal set of features.\n\n**Resource Requirements:** The MVP is planned for execution by a **solo full-stack developer**, which streamlines coordination and decision-making, allowing for efficient development and iteration.\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\nThe MVP is explicitly designed to address critical user needs and achieve \"aha!\" moments with the most efficient path to value.\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n*   **Marie Dubois (General Public):** First-Time Visitor (discovering the site's value, finding local content), Returning User (quick access to new content/events).\n*   **Mr. Thomas Leclerc (Educators):** Resource Acquisition (efficiently finding/downloading official materials), Repeat Usage (regularly checking for educational updates).\n*   **Madame Sophie Lambert (Local Officials):** Urgent Reference (rapidly confirming official guidance), Best Practice Discovery (exploring regional initiatives).\n*   **Monsieur Jean-Luc Dubois (Association Staff):** Content Publishing Workflow (efficiently adding/managing articles, events, documents).\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n*   **Content Display Foundation:**\n    *   Dedicated sections for **Articles**, **Events**, and **Documents**, offering browsable lists, detailed views, and clear metadata (date, category, city, excerpt).\n    *   **Press Reviews section:** Aggregated coverage, organized by date (initial implementation might be simpler).\n*   **Navigation & Organization:**\n    *   Intuitive main navigation structure (Home, Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews, About).\n    *   Robust **regional/city filtering** across all content types.\n    *   Basic **full-text search functionality** utilizing PostgreSQL FTS.\n    *   Clean, modern design leveraging **Shadcn UI**.\n    *   Fully responsive layout for seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.\n    *   Fast loading times and optimized performance (achieved via SSR/SSG, caching, lazy loading).\n    *   **WCAG 2.1 AA / RGAA compliant accessibility** (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, contrast ratios, text scaling).\n*   **Content Management System (CMS - for Association Staff):**\n    *   Intuitive and clean backend interface for content creation and management.\n    *   User-friendly editor (e.g., Markdown-based).\n    *   Simple image upload and automatic optimization.\n    *   Clear categorization and tagging mechanisms (city, topic, campaign).\n    *   Live preview functionality (desktop and mobile).\n    *   Metadata management fields for discoverability (SEO).\n    *   Efficient content publishing workflow with swift processing and confirmation.\n    *   Secure, role-based access control.\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\nFeatures explicitly deferred beyond Phase 1 to maintain a lean MVP.\n\n**Phase 2 (Growth Features - Quick Wins Post-Launch):**\n*   Further refined Press Reviews Section (e.g., external link aggregation beyond basic display).\n*   Homepage Hero/Featured Content sections for spotlighting key articles or events.\n*   Enhanced SEO Optimization (advanced meta tags, structured data, sitemap.xml automation refinement).\n*   Performance tuning and optimization based on real user analytics.\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion & Future Vision):**\n*   Advanced search functionalities (filters, facets, autocomplete suggestions).\n*   User authentication (e.g., for personalized content, save/bookmark features).\n*   Interactive elements (e.g., commenting on articles, event registration forms).\n*   Rich media galleries.\n*   Email notifications.\n\n**Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP (No time for this in Phase 1):**\n*   No user authentication.\n*   No user-generated content (e.g., comments, forums).\n*   No complex workflows or approval processes beyond basic content publishing.\n*   No real-time features (chat, live notifications, etc.).\n*   No integrations with external systems (beyond basic content feeds).\n*   No payment processing.\n*   No advanced analytics dashboards built into the platform.\n*   No live chat support.\n*   No event registration with live capacity counts.\n*   No collaborative editing within the CMS.\n*   No full RGAA audit and certification in MVP.\n*   No sign language videos or audio descriptions for complex visual content.\n*   No support for ancient assistive technologies beyond graceful degradation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** Mitigated by:\n*   Leveraging proven, stable architectural patterns (Next.js SSR/SSG, Django backend).\n*   Utilizing robust, community-supported frameworks and libraries (Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL, Shadcn UI).\n*   Focusing on core, well-understood capabilities for the MVP.\n*   Adopting modern development practices (CI/CD, automated testing for accessibility, performance monitoring).\n\n**Market Risks:** Addressed by:\n*   Targeting existing, known user pain points (discoverability) with concrete solutions.\n*   Building on existing valuable content, reducing content creation risk.\n*   Prioritizing SEO from day one to ensure market visibility.\n\n**Resource Risks:** Managed by:\n*   A lean \"solo developer\" model, reducing communication and coordination overhead.\n*   Strict adherence to MVP scope and explicit \"out of scope\" definitions to manage workload.\n*   Progressive enhancement ensuring a functional experience even on older browsers/devices.\n\nThis strategic scoping ensures a focused, achievable MVP that delivers significant value and sets a solid foundation for future growth.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n###

Frontend uses Jest + React Testing Library; Backend uses pytest with PostgreSQL.\n*   **Development Workflow:** Solo Developer Model (prioritize simplicity), CI/CD with GitHub Actions, specific branch strategy (`main` for auto-deploy, `develop` for tests, feature branches for lint/test).\n\nThese preferences and rules ensure consistency across the project.",

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

          "description": "Replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences when `expected_replacements` is specified. This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

JSON *response bodies* should be `camelCase`. For API data transformation, explicitly convert Python's `snake_case` to JavaScript's `camelCase` in Django REST Framework serializers using `internal_values` and `to_representation` methods, applying this conversion only where necessary.\n    *   **Backend (Python):** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) conventions.\n    *   **Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js/React):** Follow JavaScript/TypeScript conventions (`kebab-case` for files, `PascalCase` for components/types, `camelCase` for functions/variables).

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

JSON *response bodies* should be `camelCase`. For API data transformation, explicitly convert Python's `snake_case` to JavaScript's `camelCase` in Django REST Framework serializers using `internal_values` and `to_representation` methods, applying this conversion only where necessary.\n    *   **Backend (Python):** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) conventions.\n    *   **Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js/React):** Follow JavaScript/TypeScript conventions (`kebab-case` for files, `PascalCase` for components/types, `camelCase` for functions/variables). Utilize BEM with `kebab-case` for CSS classes.\n*   **Code Organization:**\n    *   Maintain the established monorepo structure.\n    *   Follow standard Next.js App Router structure for the frontend.\n    *   Adhere to standard Django project structure with dedicated apps for the backend.\n*   **Enforcement:** Automated linting, type checking, and code reviews are used to ensure adherence to these guidelines.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n*   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance in all implementation decisions.\n*   **CI/CD:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n*   **Branch Strategy:**\n    *   `main` branch: Auto-deploy to production.\n    *   `develop` branch: For integration testing only.\n    *   Feature branches: For linting and testing only.\n    *   Pull Requests (PRs): Trigger full pipeline for validation before merging.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n*   **Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n    *   Avoid over-engineering or big upfront design; favor iterative, value-driven development.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Explicitly handle Legacy WordPress URL 301 Redirects to preserve SEO and user experience.\n*   **Security Rules:**\n    *   All data, at rest and in transit, must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\n    *   Never hardcode sensitive information; always use environment variables or secure configuration management.\n*   **Performance Considerations:**\n    *   Prioritize efficient backend query optimization and appropriate caching strategies to meet performance targets.\n"

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

JSON *response bodies* should be `camelCase`. For API data transformation, explicitly convert Python's `snake_case` to JavaScript's `camelCase` in Django REST Framework serializers using `internal_values` and `to_representation` methods, applying this conversion only where necessary.\n    *   **Backend (Python):** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) conventions.\n    *   **Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js/React):** Follow JavaScript/TypeScript conventions (`kebab-case` for files, `PascalCase` for components/types, `camelCase` for functions/variables). Utilize BEM with `kebab-case` for CSS classes.\n*   **Code Organization:**\n    *   Maintain the established monorepo structure.\n    *   Follow standard Next.js App Router structure for the frontend.\n    *   Adhere to standard Django project structure with dedicated apps for the backend.\n*   **Enforcement:** Automated linting, type checking, and code reviews are used to ensure adherence to these guidelines.\n\n### Development Workflow Rules\n\n*   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance in all implementation decisions.\n*   **CI/CD:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n*   **Branch Strategy:**\n    *   `main` branch: Auto-deploy to production.\n    *   `develop` branch: For integration testing only.\n    *   Feature branches: For linting and testing only.\n    *   Pull Requests (PRs): Trigger full pipeline for validation before merging.\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n*   **Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\n    *   Avoid over-engineering or big upfront design; favor iterative, value-driven development.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Explicitly handle Legacy WordPress URL 301 Redirects to preserve SEO and user experience.\n*   **Security Rules:**\n    *   All data, at rest and in transit, must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\n    *   Never hardcode sensitive information; always use environment variables or secure configuration management.\n*   **Performance Considerations:**\n    *   Prioritize efficient backend query optimization and appropriate caching strategies to meet performance targets.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- Update this file if new patterns emerge\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when technology stack changes\n- Review quarterly for outdated rules\n- Remove rules that become obvious over time\n\nLast Updated: 2026-01-13\n"

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool.

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting.

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

access an interface to create new events (FR16).\n*   **And** The interface allows me to specify event date, time, and location.\n*   **When** I edit an existing event,\n*   **Then** I can modify its details (FR17).\n*   **When** I publish an event,\n*   **Then** The event becomes visible on the public website (FR18).\n*   **And** My actions are restricted based on my role (NFR6).\n\n### Story 2.4: Staff Upload and Manage Documents\n\nAs an **authorized staff member**,\nI want **to upload, categorize, manage metadata for, and publish official documents within the CMS**,\nSo that **I can make important resources available to the public.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am logged into the CMS and have appropriate permissions,\n*   **When** I navigate to the document management section,\n*   **Then** I can access an interface to upload new documents (FR20).\n*   **And** I can manage categories for documents (FR21).\n*   **And** I can manage metadata for documents (FR22).\n*   **When** I publish a document,\n*   **Then** The document becomes visible on the public website (FR23).\n*   **And** My actions are restricted based on my role (NFR6).\n\n### Epic 3: Enhanced Public User Experience\nPublic users can interact with content through downloads and calendar integration, experiencing a professional, accessible, and performant platform.\n**FRs covered:** FR15, FR19, FR37, FR38, FR41.\n\n### Story 3.1: Document Download and Calendar Integration\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to download documents and add events to my personal calendar**,\nSo that **I can easily save and manage relevant information.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am viewing an individual document (from Story 1.4),\n*   **When** I click on a \"Download\" button or link,\n*   **Then** The document is downloaded to my device (FR19).\n*   **When** I am viewing an individual event (from Story 1.4),\n*   **Then** I can see an option to \"Add to Calendar.\"\n*   **When** I click \"Add to Calendar,\"\n*   **Then** The event details are provided in a format compatible with popular calendar applications (e.g., iCal, Google Calendar) (FR15).\n*   **And** The download and calendar integration features are accessible (NFR9, NFR10).\n\n### Story 3.2: SEO Enhancements and Semantic Structure\n\nAs a **general public user** and **search engine bot**,\nI want **the website to have Schema.org markup, an XML sitemap, and semantic HTML**,\nSo that **content is easily discoverable by search engines and understandable by assistive technologies.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a search engine bot or using a tool to analyze the website,\n*   **When** I crawl public-facing pages for articles, events, and the organization,\n*   **Then** I can find appropriate Schema.org markup (e.g., Article, Event, Organization schemas) embedded in the HTML (FR37).\n*   **When** I request the sitemap,\n*   **Then** The system provides an automatically generated XML sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) that lists all public-facing URLs (FR38).\n*   **When** I view any public-facing page's source code,\n*   **Then** The HTML is structured semantically, using appropriate tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) (FR41, NFR9).\n*   **And** The website adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for overall accessibility (NFR9)."

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

images.\nFR29: Authorized staff can assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Authorized staff can apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Authorized staff can manage metadata for articles.\nFR32: Authorized staff can preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Authorized staff can publish articles.\nFR34: The system confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: The system provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: The system provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: The system generates Schema.org markup for articles, events, and organization.\nFR38: The system generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: The system handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: The system provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: The system generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Core public-facing pages (homepage, article list, event list, document list) shall load within **2 seconds** on a standard broadband connection.\nNFR2: Search results shall be displayed within **1 second** from query submission.\nNFR3: All images shall be optimized to ensure minimal load time impact.\nNFR4: Staff access to the Content Management Interface shall require multi-factor authentication.\nNFR5: All data, both at rest and in transit, shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\nNFR6: The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure staff can only access authorized CMS functionalities.\nNFR7: The platform shall support a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over the next 24 months without significant performance degradation (>10%).\nNFR8: The architecture shall be designed to allow for horizontal scaling of web servers and database instances.\nNFR9: The platform shall be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\nNFR10: All interactive elements shall be fully navigable and operable via keyboard.\nNFR11: All non-text content (e.g., images) shall have appropriate alternative text for

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

epic and story breakdown for laicité-2.0, decomposing the requirements from the PRD, UX Design if it exists, and Architecture requirements into implementable stories.\n\n## Requirements Inventory\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nFR1: Users can access the website homepage.\nFR2: Users can navigate the site via a main navigation menu.\nFR3: Users can browse a list of articles.\nFR4: Users can view an individual article.\nFR5: Users can browse a list of events.\nFR6: Users can view details for an individual event (date, time, location).\nFR7: Users can browse a list of official documents.\nFR8: Users can view an individual document.\nFR9: Users can browse a list of press reviews.\nFR10: Users can search for content using keywords.\nFR11: Users can filter content (articles, events, documents) by city.\nFR12: Users can browse documents by category.\nFR13: The system prioritizes search results for relevancy.\nFR14: Users can discover related content (e.g., related articles, events, documents).\nFR15: Users can add an event to their personal calendar.\nFR16: Authorized staff can create new events.\nFR17: Authorized staff can edit event details.\nFR18: Authorized staff can publish events.\nFR19: Users can download an individual document.\nFR20: Authorized staff can upload new documents.\nFR21: Authorized staff can manage categories for documents.\nFR22: Authorized staff can manage metadata for documents.\nFR23: Authorized staff can publish documents.\nFR24: Authorized staff can access a content management interface.\nFR25: Authorized staff can create new articles.\nFR26: Authorized staff can edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Authorized staff can upload images for articles.\nFR28: The system automatically optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Authorized staff can assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Authorized staff can apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Authorized staff can manage metadata for articles.\nFR32: Authorized staff can preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Authorized staff can publish articles.\nFR34: The system confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: The system provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: The system provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: The system generates Schema.org markup for articles, events, and organization.\nFR38: The system generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: The system handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: The system provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: The system generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Core public-facing pages (homepage, article list, event list, document list) shall load within **2 seconds** on a standard broadband connection.\nNFR2: Search results shall be displayed within **1 second** from query submission.\nNFR3: All images shall be optimized to ensure minimal load time impact.\nNFR4: Staff access to the Content Management Interface shall require multi-factor authentication.\nNFR5: All data, both at rest and in transit, shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\nNFR6: The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure staff can only access authorized CMS functionalities.\nNFR7: The platform shall support a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over the next 24 months without significant performance degradation (>10%).\nNFR8: The architecture shall be designed to allow for horizontal scaling of web servers and database instances.\nNFR9: The platform shall be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\nNFR10: All interactive elements shall be fully navigable and operable via keyboard.\nNFR11: All non-text content (e.g., images) shall have appropriate alternative text for screen readers.\nNFR12: The platform shall provide clear visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation.\nNFR13: The system shall maintain an uptime of 99.9% (excluding scheduled maintenance).\nNFR14: Data backups shall be performed daily and restorable within 24 hours.\nNFR15: The system shall provide an option for users to add events to popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n-   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-

Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail.

If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

images.\nFR29: Authorized staff can assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Authorized staff can apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Authorized staff can manage metadata for articles.\nFR32: Authorized staff can preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Authorized staff can publish articles.\nFR34: The system confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: The system provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: The system provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: The system generates Schema.org markup for articles, events, and organization.\nFR38: The system generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: The system handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: The system provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: The system generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n### NonFunctional Requirements\n\nNFR1: Core public-facing pages (homepage, article list, event list, document list) shall load within **2 seconds** on a standard broadband connection.\nNFR2: Search results shall be displayed within **1 second** from query submission.\nNFR3: All images shall be optimized to ensure minimal load time impact.\nNFR4: Staff access to the Content Management Interface shall require multi-factor authentication.\nNFR5: All data, both at rest and in transit, shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.\nNFR6: The system shall implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure staff can only access authorized CMS functionalities.\nNFR7: The platform shall support a 5x increase in concurrent users and content volume over the next 24 months without significant performance degradation (>10%).\nNFR8: The architecture shall be designed to allow for horizontal scaling of web servers and database instances.\nNFR9: The platform shall be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\nNFR10: All interactive elements shall be fully navigable and operable via keyboard.\nNFR11: All non-text content (e.g., images) shall have appropriate alternative text for screen readers.\nNFR12: The platform shall provide clear visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation.\nNFR13: The system shall maintain an uptime of 99.9% (excluding scheduled maintenance).\nNFR14: Data backups shall be performed daily and restorable within 24 hours.\nNFR15: The system shall provide an option for users to add events to popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n-   **Solo Developer Model:** Prioritize simplicity, robust tooling, and ease of maintenance.\n-   **Future Extensibility (Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace.

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.

          "description": "Replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences when `expected_replacements` is specified. This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

          "description": "Replaces text within a file. By default, replaces a single occurrence, but can replace multiple occurrences when `expected_replacements` is specified. This tool requires providing significant context around the change to ensure precise targeting. Always use the read_file tool to examine the file's current content before attempting a text replacement.\n      \n      The user has the ability to modify the `new_string` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.\n      \n      Expectation for required parameters:\n      1. `old_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).\n      2. `new_string` MUST be the exact literal text to replace `old_string` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that `old_string` and `new_string` are different.\n      3. `instruction` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. \n      4. NEVER escape `old_string` or `new_string`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.\n      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for `old_string`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.\n      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.\n      **Multiple replacements:** Set `expected_replacements` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match `old_string` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.",

(Authentication):** Establish a flexible foundation for future user authentication.\n-   **Image Optimization Strategy:** Backend (Django) needs a clear strategy for media storage.\n-   **Legacy WordPress Redirects:** Implement 301 redirects for legacy WordPress URLs.\n-   **Authentication System:** Use `django-allauth` + `dj-rest-auth` for token-based authentication with MFA for staff.\n-   **Authorization Pattern:** Use Django's built-in permissions and groups for fine-grained RBAC in CMS.\n-   **Caching Strategy:** Hybrid approach: TanStack Query (frontend), Next.js built-in caching, Django view-level caching, `functools.lru_cache` (backend).\n-   **API Data Transformation Strategy:** DRF handles `snake_case` to `camelCase` for API responses and vice versa for requests.\n-   **Standardized Error Response Structure:** Implement a standardized error response structure.\n-   **Inter-Service Communication (Backend):** Direct function calls, ORM access, and Django signals. Add Celery/Redis only when necessary.\n-   **Enforcement Guidelines:** Adhere to defined naming conventions, project structure, API data transformation, error handling, inter-service communication patterns, and use TanStack Query/Zustand in frontend.\n-   **CI/CD Pipeline Approach:** Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with 5 stages (Lint, Type Check, Test, Build, Deploy).\n-   **Reference Project Adoption:** Adopt architectural patterns, core technologies, and project structure from a provided reference project (Docker, Django, Next.js).\n-   **Containerization & Orchestration (ADR):** Utilize `docker-compose` for a portable, single-command development environment (`db`, `backend`, `frontend` services). (This specific entry is kept to highlight the *continued use* of docker-compose as an ongoing strategy, rather than initial setup.)\n-   **Configuration Management (ADR):** Use `env_file` directives in `docker-compose.yml` and `django-environ` for secure environment variable consumption. (Similarly, highlighting continued strategy)\n-   **Backend Modularity (ADR):** Django backend to be modular and well-structured, with pre-configured support for REST APIs (DRF), JWT cookie-based authentication (`dj-rest-auth`), and stubs for full-text search (Elasticsearch) and asynchronous tasks (Celery/Redis).\n-   **Frontend Stack (ADR):** Next.js, React, TypeScript frontend utilizing TanStack React Query for server-state management, Zustand for client state, and a UI toolkit based on Tailwind CSS and `shadcn-ui`.\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\nFR1: Epic 1 - Access homepage\nFR2: Epic 1 - Navigate main menu\nFR3: Epic 1 - Browse articles\nFR4: Epic 1 - View individual article\nFR5: Epic 1 - Browse events\nFR6: Epic 1 - View individual event details\nFR7: Epic 1 - Browse official documents\nFR8: Epic 1 - View individual document\nFR9: Epic 1 - Browse press reviews\nFR10: Epic 1 - Search content by keywords\nFR11: Epic 1 - Filter content by city\nFR12: Epic 1 - Browse documents by category\nFR13: Epic 1 - Prioritize search results for relevancy\nFR14: Epic 1 - Discover related content\nFR15: Epic 3 - Add event to personal calendar\nFR16: Epic 2 - Staff create new events\nFR17: Epic 2 - Staff edit event details\nFR18: Epic 2 - Staff publish events\nFR19: Epic 3 - Download individual document\nFR20: Epic 2 - Staff upload new documents\nFR21: Epic 2 - Staff manage document categories\nFR22: Epic 2 - Staff manage document metadata\nFR23: Epic 2 - Staff publish documents\nFR24: Epic 2 - Staff access content management interface\nFR25: Epic 2 - Staff create new articles\nFR26: Epic 2 - Staff edit article content using a Markdown-based editor.\nFR27: Epic 2 - Staff upload images for articles.\nFR28: Epic 2 - System optimizes uploaded images.\nFR29: Epic 2 - Staff assign categories to articles.\nFR30: Epic 2 - Staff apply tags to articles.\nFR31: Epic 2 - Staff manage article metadata.\nFR32: Epic 2 - Staff preview articles before publishing.\nFR33: Epic 2 - Staff publish articles.\nFR34: Epic 2 - System confirms successful article publication.\nFR35: Epic 2 - System provides a direct link to a published article.\nFR36: Epic 2 - System provides role-based access control for staff.\nFR37: Epic 3 - System generates Schema.org markup.\nFR38: Epic 3 - System generates an XML sitemap.\nFR39: Epic 1 - System handles 301 redirects for legacy URLs.\nFR40: Epic 2 - System provides meta tag management for content.\nFR41: Epic 3 - System generates semantic HTML for content.\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: Core Content Discovery & Viewing\nUsers can efficiently find and view all public content (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews), leveraging search and filtering for discoverability.\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR39.\n\n### Story 1.1: Website Homepage Access\n\nAs a **general public user**,\nI want **to access the website homepage and view featured content**,\nSo that **I can quickly get an overview of the platform's offerings and navigate to key sections.**\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Given** I am a user with an internet connection,\n*   **When** I navigate to the application's root URL (`/`),\n*   **Then** The homepage loads successfully within 2 seconds (NFR1).\n*   **And** The page displays a modern, responsive design (NFR9).\n*   **And** The page contains a prominent main navigation menu (FR2).\n*   **And** The page contains featured content or a clear entry point to various content types (Articles, Events, Documents, Press Reviews) (FR1).\n*   **And** The HTML generated is semantic and accessible (FR41, NFR9).\n\n**Tasks/Subtasks:**\n\n*   [x] Implement basic homepage layout and primary navigation menu within `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n**Dev Agent Record:**\n*   **Implementation Plan:** Created `codebase/frontend/src/app/globals.css`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`, `codebase/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to resolve Next.js startup error.
