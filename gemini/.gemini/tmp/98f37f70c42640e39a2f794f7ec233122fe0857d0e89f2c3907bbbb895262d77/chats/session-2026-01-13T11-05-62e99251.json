Based on this analysis, create an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) that:\n1.  States the decision to use this project as a reference for `laicité-2.0`'s initialization.\n2.  Justifies this decision by highlighting how it helps avoid \"AI slop\" and leverages proven patterns.\n3.  Outlines the key aspects of the reference project (e.g., Docker setup, Django app structure, Next.js configuration, environment variable management, Makefile commands) that will inform `laicité-2.0`'s setup.\n4.  Explains how these patterns will be adapted to align with the existing `laicité-2.0` architecture document.\n\nThe analysis should specifically look at:\n- `QWEN.md`: For a high-level overview.\n- `docker-compose.yml`: For service definitions, volumes, and environment variables.\n- `backend/Dockerfile`: For Python dependencies and setup.\n- `backend/conf/settings.py`: For Django configuration, installed apps, middleware, database, REST framework settings, JWT, social auth, email, static/media files, and logging.\n- `backend/apps/`: For the modular Django app structure (accounts, tech, repairs).\n- `frontend/Dockerfile`: For Node.js dependencies and setup.\n- `frontend/package.json`: For Next.js dependencies and scripts.\n- `frontend/next.config.ts`: For Next.js configuration.\n- `Makefile`: For common development commands.\n- `.envs/.local/`: For environment variable management.\n\nEnsure the ADR highlights how the monorepo structure, Django app patterns, and Next.js component/state management approaches in the reference project will inform the `laicité-2.0` project.\n</objective>"
