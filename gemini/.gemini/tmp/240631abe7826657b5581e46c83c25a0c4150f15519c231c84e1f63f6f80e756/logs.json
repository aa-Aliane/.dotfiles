The app is specifically designed for delivery drivers (livreurs) only — not for senders or recipients.\n\n    Here's what the app should include:\n    Purpose:\n\n    A simple and efficient mobile tool that helps delivery drivers manage their assigned deliveries — nothing else.\n    Core Features:\n\n        Authentication:\n\n            Login & logout flow for drivers.\n\n        Tab-Based Navigation:\n\n            Use tabs or bottom navigation to switch between main screens: Deliveries, Map, Profile.\n\n        Home/Deliveries Screen:\n\n            Show a list of current delivery assignments.\n\n            Each item includes: pickup & drop-off address, package info, and status (e.g., pending, in progress, delivered).\n\n            Ability to update the delivery status (e.g., mark as picked up, delivered).\n\n        Map View:\n\n            Display real-time map with routes between pickup and delivery points (optional basic integration for now).\n\n        Profile Screen:\n\n            View/edit driver's info.\n\n            Logout button.\n\n    Design:\n\n        Use Tamagui for consistent and elegant styling.\n\n        Keep UI clean, mobile-first, and optimized for quick actions.\n\n    Please generate the code structure and boilerplate to get this app started.",
